# FreeBSD

ZeroClaw runs natively on FreeBSD (tested on FreeBSD 15.0-RELEASE, `amd64`). Two things differ from the Linux/macOS/Windows paths:

1. **No prebuilt binary and no `install.sh` support.** FreeBSD is not a target of the bootstrap installer, so you build from source with the system Rust toolchain.
2. **No `zeroclaw service` backend.** The `zeroclaw service install` command knows systemd, OpenRC, launchd, and Windows Task Scheduler, not FreeBSD `rc.d`. You install a small `rc.d` script yourself. This page gives you a complete, tested one.

Everything else, config, providers, channels, the daemon, the gateway, is identical to any other platform.

> **When to use FreeBSD.** FreeBSD deployments are common in network-appliance, embedded, and jail-based hosting where operators want the base system’s stability, ZFS + jail primitives, or need FreeBSD for policy/licensing reasons. Because there is no prebuilt binary and the `rc.d` setup is manual, this path suits operators comfortable with FreeBSD conventions. If you are only evaluating platforms with no specific FreeBSD requirement, Linux (systemd) or macOS (launchd) onboard faster via `install.sh` and `zeroclaw service install`.

> **Grab the files instead of copy-pasting.** Every shell script and sample config shown below ships in [`dist/freebsd/`](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/tree/master/dist/freebsd): copy them to your host directly. The walkthrough explains what each piece does and why.

## System dependencies

Install the toolchain and runtime from `pkg`:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas pkg install -y rust git
```

</div>

| Package | Why |
|---|---|
| `rust` | Provides `cargo` and `rustc` to build the binary. ZeroClaw's workspace MSRV is Rust 1.87; the FreeBSD `rust` port tracks a newer stable, so `pkg install rust` satisfies it. |
| `git` | Cloning the repo, and required at runtime if you use any git-backed tools. |

> **`doas`, not `sudo`.** FreeBSD ships `doas` as the base privilege-escalation tool; `sudo` is an optional port. The examples here use `doas`. A minimal `/usr/local/etc/doas.conf` granting the `wheel` group passwordless escalation is:
>
> ```
> permit nopass keepenv :wheel
> ```

## Build from source

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw.git
cd zeroclaw
cargo build --release
```

</div>

The release binary lands at `target/release/zeroclaw`. A clean build of the default feature set takes a while on modest hardware, this is expected; ZeroClaw is a large Rust workspace.

To trim the build, disable features you don't need (see `./install.sh --list-features` on a Linux box, or `Cargo.toml`):

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features agent-runtime
```

</div>

## Install the binary

Put it somewhere on `PATH`. `/usr/local/bin` is the conventional location for ports-installed binaries on FreeBSD:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas install -m 755 target/release/zeroclaw /usr/local/bin/zeroclaw
zeroclaw --version
```

</div>

(`~/.cargo/bin/zeroclaw` works just as well if you'd rather keep it per-user.)

## First-run configuration

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
zeroclaw quickstart
```

</div>

This creates `~/.zeroclaw/` with a starter config and walks you through provider setup. Config layout and precedence are identical to every other platform: see [Reference → Config](../reference/config.md).

## Provider authentication

Provider auth is not FreeBSD-specific. API-key providers just need the key set through the gateway, zerocode, `zeroclaw config set`, or the environment. OAuth and subscription providers (e.g. an OpenAI/Codex ChatGPT subscription, Anthropic Claude Pro/Team) get their token from the vendor's own dashboard or login flow, which you then configure the same way you would an API key.

For the full credential model (API keys, OAuth/subscription tokens, env overrides, and the secrets store), see [Provider Configuration → Credentials](../providers/configuration.md#credentials) and [OAuth and subscription auth](../providers/configuration.md#oauth-and-subscription-auth). That page is the source of truth for every platform.

## Running as a service (`rc.d`)

Because `zeroclaw service install` has no FreeBSD backend, supervise the daemon with FreeBSD's native [`daemon(8)`](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?daemon%288%29) under an `rc.d` script. This gives you `service zeroclaw start|stop|restart|status`, restart-on-crash, a pidfile, and boot-time startup.

> **Ready-to-install copies of every script below live in [`dist/freebsd/`](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/tree/master/dist/freebsd)** (`zeroclaw-run.sh`, the basic `zeroclaw.rc`, and the hardened `zeroclaw-hardened.rc`). The two `rc.d` scripts carry a `@@ZEROCLAW_USER@@` placeholder you `sed` in on install, so you can grab the files instead of copy-pasting: see `dist/freebsd/README.md`. The walkthrough below explains what each piece does.

### 1. Launcher script

`daemon(8)` starts the child with a minimal environment, so export a full `PATH` (FreeBSD puts `git`, `python3`, etc. under `/usr/local/bin`, which is *not* on the default service `PATH`). The `rc.d` script runs this through `daemon -u <user>`, which per `daemon(8)` sets `HOME`, `USER`, and `SHELL` from that account's passwd entry before exec, so `${HOME}` is already the service account's home (accounts whose home is elsewhere, and `rc.conf` run-as overrides, just work). Save as `/usr/local/libexec/zeroclaw-run.sh`:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# daemon -u <user> has already set HOME from the account's passwd entry.
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:${HOME}/bin"
exec /usr/local/bin/zeroclaw daemon --config-dir "${HOME}/.zeroclaw"
```

</div>

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas install -m 755 zeroclaw-run.sh /usr/local/libexec/zeroclaw-run.sh
```

</div>

### 2. `rc.d` script

Save as `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/zeroclaw`:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
#!/bin/sh
#
# PROVIDE: zeroclaw
# REQUIRE: NETWORKING DAEMON
# KEYWORD: shutdown

. /etc/rc.subr

name="zeroclaw"
rcvar="zeroclaw_enable"

load_rc_config $name

: ${zeroclaw_enable:="NO"}
# Do NOT name this ${name}_user — rc.subr would then run its own su user-switch
# and collide with daemon -u ("failed to set user environment").
: ${zeroclaw_runas:="youruser"}

rundir="/var/run/zeroclaw"
pidfile="${rundir}/zeroclaw.pid"
logfile="/var/log/${name}.log"
launcher="/usr/local/libexec/zeroclaw-run.sh"

command="/usr/sbin/daemon"
command_args="-r -P ${pidfile} -o ${logfile} -u ${zeroclaw_runas} ${launcher}"

start_precmd="zeroclaw_precmd"

zeroclaw_precmd()
{
    # rundir + logfile stay root-owned: rc.d (root) writes the daemon -P pidfile
    # here and trusts it later, so the unprivileged service user must not be able
    # to forge it. daemon -o opens the logfile before dropping to ${zeroclaw_runas}.
    install -d -o root -g wheel -m 755 "${rundir}"
    install -o root -g wheel -m 640 /dev/null "${logfile}"
}

run_rc_command "$1"
```

</div>

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas install -m 755 zeroclaw /usr/local/etc/rc.d/zeroclaw
```

</div>

What the flags do:

- `-r`: supervise and restart the child if it exits (crash recovery).
- `-P ${pidfile}`: write the *supervisor's* pid so `service zeroclaw stop` can signal it.
- `-o ${logfile}`: redirect the child's stdout/stderr to a logfile.
- `-u ${zeroclaw_runas}`: run zeroclaw as an unprivileged user, not root.

> **Why `daemon -u` and not `su -m`.** A common pattern is `daemon ... su -m user -c launcher`. Avoid it: `su(1)` does **not** forward `SIGTERM` to its child, so `service zeroclaw stop` kills the `daemon` supervisor but leaves an orphaned `zeroclaw` process behind, and the next `start` stacks a second copy. `daemon -u user` makes `daemon(8)` the direct parent of `zeroclaw`, so it forwards the stop signal and shuts down cleanly. (If you're stuck with a `su`-based script for other reasons, add a `pkill -f "zeroclaw daemon"` sweep to its stop path.)

### 3. Enable and start

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas sysrc zeroclaw_enable=YES
doas sysrc zeroclaw_runas=youruser     # the account that owns ~/.zeroclaw

doas service zeroclaw start
doas service zeroclaw status
```

</div>

`service zeroclaw stop` / `restart` work as expected. Because `zeroclaw_enable=YES` is in `/etc/rc.conf` (written by `sysrc`), the daemon also starts on boot.

### 4. Hardening for unattended and remote operation

The script above is correct for an interactive, single-instance install. Three `daemon(8)` behaviours will surprise you the moment you drive the service remotely (over `ssh`) or run more than one copy. All three bit a production deployment; the fixes are small. A complete script folding in every fix below ships as [`dist/freebsd/zeroclaw-hardened.rc`](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/tree/master/dist/freebsd): install it in place of the basic `zeroclaw` script.

**Remote `service ... start` hangs.** `daemon -r` inherits and holds open whatever stdin/stdout/stderr it was launched with. Run `ssh host 'service zeroclaw start'` and the supervisor keeps your `ssh` session's stdout fd open forever, so `ssh` never sees EOF and the command hangs even though the daemon started fine. Detach the supervisor's own descriptors: `-o ${logfile}` already routes the *child's* output, so nothing is lost:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
command_args="-r -P ${pidfile} -o ${logfile} -u ${zeroclaw_runas} ${launcher}"
# ...invoke daemon with its own std{in,out,err} sent to /dev/null:
/usr/sbin/daemon ${command_args} </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1
```

</div>

If you use the stock `command`/`command_args` form, wrap the start in a custom `start_cmd` so you control the redirection. This one change is what makes `service zeroclaw start` safe to call from `ssh`, CI, or a config-management push.

**Repeated `start` stacks orphan supervisors.** A plain `start` does not check whether a supervisor is already running, so a second `start` (or a `start` after a crash that left a stale pidfile) launches another `daemon` that fights the first over the gateway port. Make `start` idempotent by refusing when a live supervisor already exists. Match the supervisor by the launcher path, **not** the pidfile alone (the pidfile can be stale). Two FreeBSD-specific traps when you do this:

- `daemon(8)` *retitles its supervisor* to `daemon: /usr/local/libexec/zeroclaw-run.sh[<childpid>] (daemon)`. So `pgrep -f zeroclaw-run.sh` matches the supervisor, but a `pgrep -f` for the binary name does not. Bind on the literal `daemon:` prefix: that matches the supervisor and never the child, a hand-run of the launcher, or the rc shell itself. Bind the trailing `[` that opens daemon's `[<childpid>]` too, so a sibling launcher whose name merely *starts with* `zeroclaw-run.sh` can't match (this matters once you run a pool, see [Running a pool of instances](#4-hardening-for-unattended-and-remote-operation) below).
- FreeBSD `pgrep -f` does **not** honour a leading `^` anchor against that retitle string: `pgrep -f '^daemon: ...'` matches nothing. Drop the `^`; rely on the `daemon:` prefix for specificity and escape the dot in `.sh` as `[.]` (and the bracket as `[[]`) so they are literal.

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
launcher_pat="daemon: /usr/local/libexec/zeroclaw-run[.]sh[[]"

zeroclaw_running()
{
    pgrep -f "${launcher_pat}" >/dev/null 2>&1
}
```

</div>

**`read` from a `daemon -P` pidfile reports a false negative.** `daemon -P` writes the pid with **no trailing newline**, so `IFS= read -r pid < "${pidfile}"` returns a *non-zero* status (EOF before newline) even though it set `pid` correctly. If you guard it as `read -r pid < "$pf" || return 1`, every running instance looks stopped and your idempotent `start` happily launches a duplicate. Don't key the success path on `read`'s exit status: validate the value instead:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
pid=""
IFS= read -r pid < "${pidfile}"     # do NOT `|| return 1` here
case "${pid}" in
    ''|*[!0-9]*) return 1 ;;        # empty or non-numeric → treat as not running
esac
```

</div>

**Running a pool of instances.** To run N daemons (e.g. a worker pool), give each its own pidfile and logfile (`worker.$i.pid`, `worker.$i.log`) and loop the start/stop over `$i`. Because the supervisor retitle is identical for every instance and does not include per-instance arguments, the **pidfile is the only per-instance handle**: drive stop/status from the pidfile, and on a full stop sweep any leftover supervisor that no live pidfile points at (started by hand, or whose pidfile went stale).

## Running in a jail

[Jails](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/jails/) give ZeroClaw an isolated root with its own packages, service user, and optionally its own IP, useful if the host runs other services or you want to constrain the agent. **The service setup is identical to the host case; you just run it *inside* the jail.** This walks through a classic thick jail with base-system tooling (no jail manager required).

> **One-step option.** [`dist/freebsd/zeroclaw-jail-setup.sh`](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw/tree/master/dist/freebsd) automates steps 1–3 below: it creates the jail, extracts a matching base, adds the `/etc/jail.conf` entry, starts the jail, and installs the launcher + hardened `rc.d` script inside it (`doas sh zeroclaw-jail-setup.sh`, with `JAIL_NAME` / `JAIL_PATH` / `ZPOOL` / `ZEROCLAW_USER` overridable via env). The manual walkthrough below explains what it does.

### 1. Create the jail

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
# ZFS dataset for the jail (use a plain directory if you're on UFS).
doas zfs create -o mountpoint=/jails/zeroclaw zroot/jails/zeroclaw   # adjust pool

# Extract a base matching the HOST's release into it.
doas fetch -o /tmp/base.txz \
    "https://download.freebsd.org/releases/$(uname -m)/$(freebsd-version -u)/base.txz"
doas tar -xpf /tmp/base.txz -C /jails/zeroclaw
doas cp /etc/resolv.conf /jails/zeroclaw/etc/
```

</div>

### 2. Configure and start

Add a jail entry to `/etc/jail.conf` (host side). This example shares the host network; set `ip4.addr` instead if you give the jail a dedicated address.

```
zeroclaw {
    host.hostname = "zeroclaw";
    path = "/jails/zeroclaw";
    exec.start = "/bin/sh /etc/rc";
    exec.stop  = "/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown";
    exec.clean;
    mount.devfs;
    persist;
}
```

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas sysrc jail_enable=YES
doas sysrc jail_list+=" zeroclaw"
doas service jail start zeroclaw
```

</div>

### 3. Install ZeroClaw inside the jail

Everything from the sections above runs *inside* the jail: prefix commands with `doas jexec zeroclaw …`, or open a shell with `doas jexec zeroclaw /bin/sh`:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas jexec zeroclaw pkg install -y rust git     # or copy a binary built on the host
# build + install zeroclaw to /usr/local/bin/zeroclaw exactly as above, then:
doas jexec zeroclaw pw useradd zeroclaw -m -s /usr/sbin/nologin
```

</div>

Install the launcher and `rc.d` script into the **jail's** filesystem (from the host, the jail root is prefixed: `/jails/zeroclaw/usr/local/libexec/…` and `/jails/zeroclaw/usr/local/etc/rc.d/…`). Then enable and start the service *inside* the jail:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas jexec zeroclaw sysrc zeroclaw_enable=YES
doas jexec zeroclaw service zeroclaw start
doas jexec zeroclaw service zeroclaw status
```

</div>

### Jail-specific notes

- **Edit jail files from the host with `tee`, not `cp /dev/stdin`.** Pipe through `… | doas tee /jails/zeroclaw/usr/local/etc/rc.d/zeroclaw >/dev/null`; `doas cp /dev/stdin …` can fail mid-copy with `cp: /dev/stdin: File changed`.
- **The gateway binds inside the jail.** The daemon listens on loopback by default: to reach it from the host or LAN, launch zeroclaw with `--host 0.0.0.0` (edit `zeroclaw-run.sh`) and give the jail a reachable address, or proxy from the host.
- **Prefer the hardened `rc.d` script in a jail.** You'll typically drive `service` non-interactively via `jexec`/`ssh`, which is exactly where the basic script's `start` hang and orphan-stacking bite: see [Hardening](#4-hardening-for-unattended-and-remote-operation). It also keeps `/var/run/zeroclaw` root-owned inside the jail so the unprivileged service user can't forge the supervisor pidfile.
- **Running several daemons in one jail** (e.g. a worker pool) follows the pool note in the hardening section: one pidfile/logfile per instance and a `pgrep` bound to the launcher retitle, since the jail shares one process table.

## Running the Linux image under Podman + Linuxulator

The native build above is the right path for ZeroClaw itself. But some Python-backed
tools and skills depend on **manylinux-only wheels**: `polars`, `pyarrow`, and
`oracledb`, for example, publish no FreeBSD wheels, so a tool that imports them can't
run under the native FreeBSD `python3`. FreeBSD's [Linuxulator](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/linuxemu/)
(Linux binary-compatibility layer) plus Podman lets you run the **official Linux
container image** on a FreeBSD host, giving those tools the Linux ABI they expect.
This complements the native `rc.d` daemon: you can run either, or both side by side.

### 1. Prerequisites

Enable the Linux ABI and confirm it reports a Linux release:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas sysrc linux_enable="YES"
doas service linux start              # loads the modules and mounts /compat/linux
sysctl compat.linux.osrelease         # e.g. compat.linux.osrelease: 5.15.0
```

</div>

`linux_enable="YES"` in `/etc/rc.conf` also loads the ABI on boot. Then install Podman:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas pkg install -y podman
```

</div>

### 2. Pull the image: force the Linux platform

FreeBSD Podman defaults to `os=freebsd` when resolving a manifest list. ZeroClaw's
images are published only for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, so a plain `podman pull`
fails with `no image found in manifest list for architecture ..., OS freebsd`. Force
the Linux platform explicitly:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas podman pull --os linux --arch amd64 ghcr.io/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw:debian
```

</div>

> Use the `debian` tag rather than `latest`: the distroless `latest` image has no
> shell, which makes it awkward to debug under emulation. See
> [Docker & Containers](./container.md) for the full image list.

### 3. Run the container

The Linux image behaves exactly as documented in [Docker & Containers](./container.md),
it expects persistent state at `/zeroclaw-data` and bootstraps a config on first run:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas podman run -d --name zeroclaw --restart=always \
    --os linux --arch amd64 \
    -p 42617:42617 \
    -v /var/db/zeroclaw:/zeroclaw-data \
    ghcr.io/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw:debian

doas podman exec -it zeroclaw zeroclaw quickstart
```

</div>

Keep the `--os linux --arch amd64` flags on every `run` (not just `pull`) so Podman
doesn't re-resolve to the FreeBSD default.

### Linuxulator notes

- **Boot persistence.** Podman's own `--restart=always` only restarts the container
  within a running Podman; it won't survive a host reboot on its own. Supervise the
  `podman start` from an `rc.d` script (same pattern as the [native service](#running-as-a-service-rcd))
  or a `@reboot` cron entry so the container comes back after the host restarts.
- **Networking.** `-p 42617:42617` publishes the gateway through Podman's bridge. If
  the bridge/CNI setup isn't configured on your host, `--network host` is the simplest
  alternative: the container then shares the host's network stack directly.
- **Not everything emulates cleanly.** Linuxulator covers the common syscall surface,
  but exotic binaries may hit unimplemented calls. If a tool misbehaves, check
  `dmesg` for `linux:` warnings before assuming a ZeroClaw bug.

## Logs

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
tail -f /var/log/zeroclaw.log
```

</div>

Set the log level via the standard config / env knobs: see [Operations → Logs & observability](../ops/observability.md).

## Verify

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
zeroclaw --version
service zeroclaw status
# if the daemon exposes the local gateway (default 127.0.0.1:42617):
fetch -qo - http://127.0.0.1:42617/health
```

</div>

A `"status":"ok"` health payload means the gateway is up; the response's `runtime` field carries the per-component health (channels, providers, and so on).

## Uninstall

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
doas service zeroclaw stop
doas sysrc -x zeroclaw_enable
doas rm /usr/local/etc/rc.d/zeroclaw /usr/local/libexec/zeroclaw-run.sh
doas rm /usr/local/bin/zeroclaw
rm -rf ~/.zeroclaw        # optional — deletes config + history
```
