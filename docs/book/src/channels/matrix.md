# Matrix

Run ZeroClaw in Matrix rooms, including end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) rooms.

Common failure mode this guide targets:

> "Matrix is configured correctly, checks pass, but the bot does not respond."

## Fast FAQ

If Matrix appears connected but there's no reply, validate these first:

1. Sender is allowed by `allowed_users` (for testing: `["*"]`).
2. Bot account has joined the exact target room.
3. Token belongs to the same bot account (`whoami` check — see §5C).
4. Encrypted room has usable device identity (`device_id`) and key sharing.
5. Daemon was restarted after config changes.

## 1. Requirements

Before testing message flow:

1. The bot account is joined to the target room.
2. The access token belongs to the same bot account.
3. `allowed_rooms` includes the target room (or is empty to allow all rooms the bot has joined). Each entry is either a canonical room ID (`!room:server`) or an alias (`#alias:server`); ZeroClaw resolves aliases.
4. `allowed_users` allows the sender (`["*"]` for open testing).
5. For E2EE rooms, the bot device has received encryption keys for the room.

## 2. Configuration

All config management goes through `zeroclaw config` or `zeroclaw onboard`. Do not hand-edit `~/.zeroclaw/config.toml`.

Easiest: run the wizard and let it prompt for every Matrix field:

```bash
zeroclaw onboard channels
```

Or set individual fields after onboarding:

```bash
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.homeserver https://matrix.example.com
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.access-token           # prompts, input masked
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.user-id @bot:matrix.example.com
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.device-id ABCDEF1234
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.allowed-users '["*"]'   # open for testing
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.allowed-rooms '["!room:matrix.example.com"]'  # empty list = allow all joined rooms
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.ack-reactions true       # default: true (👀 → ✅)
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.reply-in-thread true     # default: true
```

Required: `homeserver`, `access-token`, `allowed-users`. Strongly recommended for E2EE: `user-id` and `device-id`. `allowed-rooms` is optional — leave empty to allow every room the bot has joined, or list explicit IDs/aliases to restrict. For the full field index, see the [Config reference](../reference/config.md).

> **Don't have an `access-token` yet?** See §3 below — it walks through the Matrix password-login API call that mints a token plus a stable `device_id` in one shot. If you only need to look up `device_id` for a token you already have, see §5H.

### About `user-id` and `device-id`

- ZeroClaw attempts to read identity from Matrix `/_matrix/client/v3/account/whoami`.
- If `whoami` doesn't return `device_id`, set `device-id` manually — critical for E2EE session restore.

## 3. Obtaining `access-token` and `device-id`

Brand-new bot accounts need a Matrix access token before ZeroClaw can connect. Element doesn't expose the token directly, so the canonical path is a one-shot password-login API call that returns both the access token and a stable device ID together.

If your operator account already has a token (e.g. you copied it from another deployment), skip to §4. If you only need to look up the `device_id` for an existing token, see §5H Option 1 (`whoami`) or Option 2 (Element).

### Step 1 — Mint a token via password login

Run this once. Replace `your.homeserver`, the bot username, password, and pick any short `device_id` string (alphanumeric, no spaces — this is the *server-side* device label that ZeroClaw will reuse on every restart):

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "https://your.homeserver/_matrix/client/v3/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"m.login.password","identifier":{"type":"m.id.user","user":"YOUR_BOT_USERNAME"},"password":"YOUR_PASSWORD","device_id":"NEW_DEVICE_ID"}'
```

Response:

```json
{"user_id": "@bot:example.com", "access_token": "syt_...", "device_id": "NEWDEVICE"}
```

### Step 2 — Apply both values to ZeroClaw

```bash
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.access-token    # paste the access_token (input is masked)
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.device-id NEWDEVICE
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.user-id @bot:example.com
```

Restart for the new values to take effect: `zeroclaw service restart`.

The wizard (`zeroclaw onboard channels`) prompts for these same fields if you'd rather work through it interactively.

### Notes

- **Keep a copy of the token** when you first paste it. Secrets are encrypted at rest and `zeroclaw config get` will print `[masked]` for the token field; you can't retrieve it later. Stash it in a scratch note if you'll need it for the curl validation snippets in §5C.
- **Reuse the same `device_id` on every restart** — changing it forces a new server-side device registration, which breaks key sharing and verification in encrypted rooms. The auto-recovery path in §8 handles the rare cases where wiping is genuinely the right call.
- **Rotating the access token later** without re-running the wizard: run `zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.access-token` (prompts, input masked), then `zeroclaw service restart`.
- **Token shows as expired or invalid** at startup: mint a new one with the same curl, repeat Step 2.

## 4. Quick validation

Run `zeroclaw onboard channels` if you haven't yet, then restart with `zeroclaw service restart` (background) or `zeroclaw daemon` (foreground). Send a plain-text message in the configured Matrix room. Confirm:

- ZeroClaw logs show the Matrix listener starting with no repeated sync/auth errors.
- In an encrypted room, the bot can read and reply to encrypted messages from allowed users.

## 5. Troubleshooting "no response"

Work through in order.

### A. Room and membership

- Confirm the bot account has joined the room.
- If using an alias (`#...`), verify it resolves to the expected canonical room.

### B. Sender allowlist

- If `allowed_users = []`, all inbound messages are denied.
- For diagnosis, temporarily open it: run `zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.allowed-users '["*"]'`, then `zeroclaw service restart`.
- Tighten to explicit user IDs once the flow works.

### C. Token and identity

> **About `$MATRIX_TOKEN` in the snippets below.** Secrets in ZeroClaw are encrypted at rest and intentionally **not** retrievable via `zeroclaw config get` — it prints `[masked]` for any secret field. You have two options:
>
> 1. **Get a fresh token** by re-running the password-login curl from §3 Step 1. Export the `access_token` it returns. Good for validation and recovery paths — doesn't affect what's in your config.
> 2. **Keep a copy** of the token when you first paste it into `zeroclaw onboard` or `zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.access-token`. A one-time side-effect — write it to a scratch note if you want to run these curl checks later.
>
> The non-secret fields *are* retrievable:
>
> ```bash
> MATRIX_HOMESERVER=$(zeroclaw config get channels.matrix.homeserver)
> MATRIX_USER=$(zeroclaw config get channels.matrix.user-id)
> ```

With `MATRIX_TOKEN` set, validate the token server-side:

```bash
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $MATRIX_TOKEN" \
  "$MATRIX_HOMESERVER/_matrix/client/v3/account/whoami"
```

- Returned `user_id` must match the bot account.
- If `device_id` is missing from the response, set it manually (see §5H).
- Rotate the access token without re-running onboard: `zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.access-token` (prompts, masked), then `zeroclaw service restart`.

### D. E2EE-specific checks

- The bot device must have received room keys from trusted devices.
- If keys haven't been shared to this device, encrypted events cannot be decrypted.
- Verify device trust and key sharing from a trusted Matrix session.
- `matrix_sdk_crypto::backups: Trying to backup room keys but no backup key was found` — key backup recovery isn't enabled on this device yet. Non-fatal for message flow; still worth completing (see §5I).
- If recipients see bot messages as "unverified", verify/sign the bot device from a trusted Matrix session and keep `device-id` stable across restarts.

### E. Log levels

ZeroClaw suppresses `matrix_sdk`, `matrix_sdk_base`, and `matrix_sdk_crypto` to `warn` by default — they're noisy at `info`. Restore SDK output for debugging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info,matrix_sdk=info,matrix_sdk_base=info,matrix_sdk_crypto=info zeroclaw daemon
```

### F. Message formatting (Markdown)

- ZeroClaw sends Matrix replies as markdown-capable `m.room.message` text content.
- Matrix clients that support `formatted_body` render emphasis, lists, and code blocks.
- If formatting appears as plain text: check client capability first, then confirm ZeroClaw is running a build with markdown-enabled Matrix output.

### G. Fresh start test

After config changes, restart the daemon and send a new message. Old timeline history won't be replayed.

### H. Finding `device_id` for an existing token

Use this when you already have an access token (e.g. inherited from another deployment) and need to look up its `device_id`. For brand-new bots, see §3 — the password-login flow there returns both values together.

ZeroClaw needs a stable `device_id` for E2EE session restore. Without it, a new device is registered every restart, breaking key sharing and device verification.

#### Option 1 — `whoami` (easiest)

```bash
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $MATRIX_TOKEN" \
  "https://your.homeserver/_matrix/client/v3/account/whoami"
```

Response includes `device_id` if the token is bound to a device session:

```json
{"user_id": "@bot:example.com", "device_id": "ABCDEF1234"}
```

If `device_id` is missing, the token was created without a device login (e.g. via the admin API). Mint a new token + device_id together via §3.

#### Option 2 — From Element or another Matrix client

1. Log in as the bot account in Element.
2. Settings → Sessions.
3. Copy the Device ID for the active session.
4. Apply:

```bash
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.device-id ABCDEF1234
```

Then `zeroclaw service restart`. Keep `device-id` stable — changing it forces a new device registration, which breaks existing key sharing and verification.

### H (continued). Crypto-store deletion recovery

**Symptom:** `Matrix one-time key upload conflict detected; stopping sync to avoid infinite retry loop` and the channel becomes unavailable.

**Cause:** The local crypto store was deleted while the old device still had one-time keys registered on the homeserver. The SDK can't upload new keys because the old keys still exist server-side, causing an infinite OTK conflict loop.

#### Fix — fresh login

A fresh login creates a new device with a new `device_id`, sidestepping the OTK conflict entirely (no UIA-gated device deletion required).

1. Stop ZeroClaw.

   ```bash
   zeroclaw service stop
   ```

2. Get a fresh access token and `device_id`:

   ```bash
   curl -sS -X POST "https://matrix.org/_matrix/client/v3/login" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"type":"m.login.password","identifier":{"type":"m.id.user","user":"YOUR_BOT_USERNAME"},"password":"YOUR_PASSWORD","device_id":"NEW_DEVICE_ID"}'
   ```

   Save the returned `access_token` and `device_id`.

3. Delete the local crypto store:

   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.zeroclaw/state/matrix/
   ```

4. Apply the new credentials:

   ```bash
   zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.access-token <new_token>
   zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.device-id <new_device_id>
   ```

5. Restart:

   ```bash
   zeroclaw service start
   ```

#### What to expect on first restart

- `Our own device might have been deleted` — harmless; old device is gone.
- `Failed to decrypt a room event` — old messages from before the reset; unrecoverable.
- `Matrix E2EE recovery successful` — room keys restored from server backup (only if `recovery_key` is set; see §5I).
- New messages decrypt and work normally.

**Prevention:** Don't delete the local state directory without planning a fresh login. If you need a fresh start, get new credentials first, then delete the store, then update config.

### I. Recovery key (recommended for E2EE)

A recovery key lets ZeroClaw automatically restore room keys and cross-signing secrets from server-side backup. Device resets, crypto-store deletions, and fresh installs all recover automatically — no emoji verification, no manual key sharing.

#### Step 1 — Get your recovery key from Element

1. Log into the bot account in Element (web or desktop).
2. Settings → Security & Privacy → Encryption → Secure Backup.
3. If backup is already set up, your recovery key was shown when you first enabled it. If you saved it, use that.
4. If backup isn't set up, click "Set up Secure Backup" → "Generate a Security Key". Save the key — it looks like `EsTj 3yST y93F SLpB ...`.
5. Log out of Element.

#### Step 2 — Add the recovery key to ZeroClaw

Either path works. The onboarding wizard is easier for fresh installs; `zeroclaw config set` is preferred for existing installs.

**Option A — during onboarding:**

```bash
zeroclaw onboard channels
```

When prompted:

```
E2EE recovery key (or Enter to skip): EsTj 3yST y93F SLpB jJsz ...
```

Input is masked. The key is encrypted at rest.

**Option B — existing installs:**

```bash
zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.recovery-key    # input masked
```

Then `zeroclaw service restart`. The recovery key is encrypted at rest immediately.

#### Step 3 — Restart

```bash
zeroclaw service restart
```

On startup you should see:

```
Matrix E2EE recovery successful — room keys and cross-signing secrets restored from server backup.
```

From now on, even if the local crypto store is deleted, ZeroClaw recovers automatically on next startup.

## 6. Debug logging

Matrix-channel-specific diagnostics:

```bash
RUST_LOG=zeroclaw::channels::matrix=debug zeroclaw daemon
```

Surfaces:

- Session restore confirmation
- Each sync cycle completion
- OTK conflict flag state
- Health check results
- Transient vs. fatal sync error classification

For SDK-level detail as well:

```bash
RUST_LOG=zeroclaw::channels::matrix=debug,matrix_sdk_crypto=debug zeroclaw daemon
```

## 7. Operational notes

- Keep Matrix tokens out of logs and screenshots.
- Start with permissive `allowed_users`, tighten to explicit user IDs once verified.
- Prefer canonical room IDs in production to avoid alias drift.
- **Threading:** when `channels.matrix.reply-in-thread` is `true` (default), every bot reply lives in a thread rooted at the user's message. Top-level user messages open a fresh thread; existing threads are continued. The main room timeline only carries the user-initiated messages.
- **Thread root context:** the first inbound message ZeroClaw sees in any given thread is prefixed with `[Thread root from @sender]: <root body>` so the agent has the conversation that triggered the reply. Threads the bot itself started skip the preamble. Tracking is in-memory only — after a daemon restart, the next message in each active thread re-injects the preamble exactly once.
- **Inline-reply media:** `channels.matrix.mention-only = true` makes the bot ignore naked media uploads (no text body to mention against). When the user inline-replies to such a dropped event with a question (`@bot can you see this?`), ZeroClaw walks the reply's `m.relates_to.m.in_reply_to.event_id`, fetches the parent event, and pulls its media into the current message — the agent's vision pipeline sees the image even though the original upload was filtered out.
- **Attachments thread alongside text:** `room.send_attachment` calls carry an `AttachmentConfig::reply(...)` with `EnforceThread::Threaded` when a thread anchor is present, so PDFs / images / voice notes land inside the bot's thread instead of the main timeline.
- **Outbound media markers:** the agent emits `[image:url|path]`, `[file:url|path]`, `[voice:url|path]`, `[video:...]`, `[audio:...]` (and uppercase / `[document:...]` aliases) inside its reply text; ZeroClaw fetches the bytes (HTTP for `http(s)://`, local read otherwise) and uploads as the appropriate Matrix message event. **Missing or unreadable targets are non-fatal:** the channel logs a warning, drops just that marker, and appends a `(note: I couldn't deliver the file at <path>.)` line so the operator sees what was attempted instead of a silently-dropped reply.
- **Voice messages** (MSC3245): inbound `m.audio` events carrying the `org.matrix.msc3245.voice` field are saved to `{workspace_dir}/matrix_files/` and run through `[transcription]` so the agent gets both the transcript text and the source path. Outbound voice notes use the `[voice:<url|path>]` marker; ZeroClaw uploads as `m.audio` with the voice flag + zero-waveform set so Element renders the bubble as a voice note. Default transcription provider is Groq's hosted Whisper API — set `transcription.default-provider = "local_whisper"` and `transcription.local-whisper.url` for fully on-device transcription.
- **Acknowledgement reactions:** controlled by `channels.matrix.ack-reactions` (default `true`). When on, the bot reacts with 👀 while processing and ✅ when done. Set to `false` to keep rooms reaction-free.
- **Streaming modes** (`channels.matrix.stream-mode`):
    - `off` (default) — reply posts as a single message once the agent finishes.
    - `partial` — initial draft posted immediately, edited in place every `draft-update-interval-ms` as the agent generates output. Tool-execution status is shown by the same edit pipeline.
    - `multi_message` — no initial draft. Each `\n\n`-bounded paragraph posts as its own threaded message, separated by `multi-message-delay-ms`. Code-fence-aware: blank lines inside ```fenced``` blocks aren't treated as paragraph breaks.
- **Persistent sessions:** on first successful login, ZeroClaw writes `~/.zeroclaw/state/matrix/session.json` (user_id + device_id + access_token + optional refresh_token). Subsequent restarts call `restore_session()` from that blob — no re-login. The matrix-rust-sdk SQLite crypto store lives alongside it at `~/.zeroclaw/state/matrix/store/`. **Once `session.json` exists, rotating `access-token` in config has no effect until the file is deleted** — the saved token wins. Delete `session.json` to force a re-login from config values.
- **Cross-signing:** when `recovery-key` matches what is sealed in your account's server-side secret storage, ZeroClaw runs `recovery().recover(key)` on every startup, the SDK imports your existing master / self-signing / user-signing keys, and the freshly registered device is automatically signed. **No bootstrap, no UIA, no key rotation.** If your account doesn't yet have cross-signing set up, generate the recovery key in Element (Settings → Security & Privacy → Secure Backup) before configuring `recovery-key`.
- **Cron delivery:** `delivery.to` should be a plain room id (`!abc:server`) or alias (`#room:server`). Older configs that wrote `<sender>||<room>` are tolerated — ZeroClaw extracts the last `!`/`#`-prefixed segment and warns about the malformed value.

## 8. Auto-recovery from corrupted local state

The matrix-rust-sdk default SQLite store is single-device and assumes the local view stays in sync with the homeserver. Two failure modes break that assumption irrecoverably; ZeroClaw detects each at startup and (when `password` + `user-id` are both configured) auto-wipes `~/.zeroclaw/state/matrix/` and re-authenticates so a fresh device is created server-side.

- **Orphan crypto state.** A `store/` directory exists but `session.json` doesn't (manual cleanup, interrupted prior install, etc.). Logging in fresh on top of orphaned crypto state reproduces `Duplicate one-time keys` / `SigningKeyChanged` conflicts that don't self-heal.
- **`StateStoreDataKey::OneTimeKeyAlreadyUploaded` flag set.** The SDK persists this key into the state store the first time it sees a duplicate-OTK upload (per the SDK's own comment: "we forgot about some of our one-time keys. This will lead to UTDs."). It survives restarts; the only fix is wipe and re-register.

**`device-id` drift is detected but tolerated, not wiped.** If `channels.matrix.device-id` differs from the device id stored in `session.json`, the channel logs a warning and honors the saved id (which is the value the homeserver actually assigned at login). Wiping on drift would create a recovery loop because auto-recovery itself generates a new id, leaving config and session permanently out of sync.

When **`recover()` itself fails** (typically `MAC check for the secret storage key failed`), the channel logs the homeserver's default secret-storage key id, whether the key event has passphrase info, the whitespace-stripped input length, and the full error chain — these point at *which* layer rejected the recovery key without leaking the value. Recovery failures are **non-fatal** (they don't trigger auto-wipe); the bot continues, the new device just won't be cross-signed.

If `password` + `user-id` aren't configured, auto-recovery can't run — the channel bails with an actionable error pointing at the two choices: configure them, or `rm -rf ~/.zeroclaw/state/matrix/` manually.
