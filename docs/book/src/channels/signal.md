# Signal

ZeroClaw's Signal channel talks to a running `signal-cli` HTTP daemon. Signal does not provide an official bot API, so ZeroClaw connects to `signal-cli` over local HTTP and lets `signal-cli` own the Signal account, device keys, and message transport.

Use this channel when you already operate a Signal account with `signal-cli`, or when you can run the daemon next to ZeroClaw. If you only have the Signal desktop or mobile app installed, that is not enough by itself; ZeroClaw needs the HTTP daemon endpoint.

## Who can talk to the agent

{{#peer-group signal}}

You can also narrow traffic at the channel level: `dm_only = true` ignores
groups; `group_ids = ["<signal-group-id>"]` accepts only listed groups while
still accepting DMs; `ignore_attachments` and `ignore_stories` drop those
message types before they reach the agent.

## Prerequisites

- A Signal account linked or registered in `signal-cli`.
- A running `signal-cli` HTTP daemon, for example `signal-cli daemon --http 127.0.0.1:8686`.
- A ZeroClaw build with the `channel-signal` feature enabled.

Keep the daemon bound to localhost unless you have put it behind your own authenticated network boundary. The daemon can send and receive as the linked Signal account.

## Configure the channel

{{#config-fields channels.signal}}

{{#config-where channels signal}}

Bind the channel to an agent via that agent's `channels` list.

## Start and check

Start the daemon first, then start ZeroClaw channels:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
signal-cli daemon --http 127.0.0.1:8686
zeroclaw channel start
```

</div>

Use `zeroclaw channel doctor` to confirm ZeroClaw can load the configured channel. If the channel fails at runtime, check that `http_url` points at the daemon, the account is registered in `signal-cli`, and the build includes `channel-signal`.

## Common confusion

The `signal-cli` project is primarily known as a CLI, but ZeroClaw needs its HTTP daemon mode. If you installed only the command-line binary and never started the daemon, ZeroClaw has nothing to connect to.
