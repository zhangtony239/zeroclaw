# Running Python Skills

ZeroClaw can run Python skills, but realistic Python work usually needs one of two explicit deployment choices:

- run the skill on a trusted host Python environment, or
- run it inside a custom Docker runtime image that already contains Python and the packages the skill needs.

The default configuration is intentionally conservative. It blocks many copy-paste Python patterns until you decide which trust boundary you want.

This page covers Python scripts invoked through the built-in shell tool. If a `SKILL.toml` defines its own `[[tools]]` entry with `kind = "shell"` or `kind = "script"`, that skill tool currently executes as a host subprocess under shell policy, not through `runtime.kind = "docker"`. For containerized Python execution today, either have the skill instructions call Python scripts through the built-in shell tool, or make the skill tool command explicitly run the container boundary you want.

## The Three Layers

Python skill execution is controlled by three separate layers.

| Layer | Config surface | What it decides |
|---|---|---|
| Skill audit | `[skills].allow_scripts` | Whether shell-like helper files can load from a skill package. Python `.py` helpers are allowed by default. |
| Shell policy | `[risk_profiles.<alias>].allowed_commands` | Whether the shell tool may invoke `python`, `python3`, `pip`, or another executable. |
| Execution boundary | `[risk_profiles.<alias>].sandbox_*` and `[runtime]` | Where the allowed command actually runs, and what filesystem, network, and resource limits apply. |

Python helper files do not require `allow_scripts = true`. Enable shell-like helper files only after you have reviewed the skill source, and allow the interpreter (`python`, `python3`, `pip`) in the risk profile's `allowed_commands`. `allowed_commands` is a strict executable allowlist when it is non-empty. The shell policy still checks destructive patterns and interpreter argument risks on top of that allowlist.

Prefer installing Python packages at image build time, in a reviewed local virtual environment, or in another setup step outside the agent turn. Add `pip` to a trusted profile only when runtime package installation is an intentional part of that deployment.

## What Stays Blocked

ZeroClaw deliberately blocks inline interpreter execution such as:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
python3 -c 'print("hello")'
python3 -m http.server
python3 -m pip install requests
node -e 'console.log(process.env)'
```

</div>

For Python skills, put code in an auditable script file and run that file:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
python3 skills/portfolio/run.py
```

</div>

This makes the executable file reviewable by the skill audit path and avoids turning a shell command string into an arbitrary code container.

Environment-variable prefixes such as `PYTHONPATH=... python3 script.py` are also policy-sensitive. Prefer a wrapper script, a project-local virtual environment, or explicit configuration inside the script when you need stable runtime environment setup.

## Pattern A: Trusted Native Python

Use native execution when the skills are trusted and you want them to use the host's Python installation, packages, filesystem permissions, and network.

This is appropriate for local development, a single-user workstation, or a home lab where you wrote the skill. It removes OS-level sandboxing for tool runs under that profile, so normal user permissions and ZeroClaw policy checks are the remaining guardrails.

Do not use this pattern for unreviewed third-party skills or multi-tenant deployments.

## Pattern B: Custom Docker Runtime Image

Use Docker when you want Python dependencies to live in a repeatable container image and you still want a runtime boundary around built-in shell execution.

Create an image with the packages your skills need:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile.skill-exec
FROM python:3.12-slim

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir \
    pandas \
    polars \
    requests

WORKDIR /workspace
```

Build it:

<div class="os-tabs-src">

#### sh

```sh
docker build -f Dockerfile.skill-exec -t zeroclaw-python-skills:local .
```

</div>

Point ZeroClaw at the image via `runtime.kind = "docker"`, which runs shell invocations in an ephemeral container. Docker-specific image, network, memory, CPU, read-only rootfs, and workspace mount settings live under `runtime.docker`.

Set `sandbox_backend = "none"` to avoid wrapping the Docker runtime in a second, separate sandbox container. In this pattern the Docker runtime is the execution boundary for built-in shell invocations, and `runtime.docker` is where the image and container limits are configured.

If a skill needs outbound HTTP, change `runtime.docker.network` deliberately. If a skill needs to write package caches, reports, or temporary state outside the mounted workspace, review whether it should instead write under `/workspace`, then relax `read_only_rootfs` only when that is not enough.

## Workspace Mounts

When `runtime.docker.mount_workspace = true`, ZeroClaw mounts the configured workspace at `/workspace` in the container and sets the container workdir there. Skill scripts should use workspace-relative paths whenever possible.

If your workspace path must be constrained further, configure the workspace allowlist. ZeroClaw validates the host workspace path against that allowlist before adding the Docker volume mount.

## Choosing a Pattern

- Use trusted native Python when you wrote or reviewed the skills and want the lowest latency on a single-user host.
- Use a custom Docker runtime image when you need repeatable dependencies, production packaging, or an explicit container boundary for built-in shell calls.
- Use stricter risk profiles, narrower command allowlists, and containerized execution for unreviewed or multi-tenant skill sources.
