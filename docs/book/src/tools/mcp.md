# MCP

ZeroClaw is an MCP client: it connects to external [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers and exposes their tools to the agent. Each MCP tool is namespaced as `<server>__<tool>` (for example `filesystem__read_file`), so tools from different servers never collide.

## Configure MCP

MCP support is enabled by default, but no external MCP tools are exposed until at least one server is configured under `mcp.servers` and an agent is granted that server through its `mcp_bundles` (see Per-agent server scoping below). Configure through the gateway, zerocode, or `zeroclaw config set`:

```sh
zeroclaw config set mcp.servers.filesystem.command npx
```

Set `mcp.enabled = false` to disable MCP tool loading without removing server definitions.

## Per-agent server scoping (`mcp_bundles`)

A `[[mcp.servers]]` entry only *defines* a server. Which servers an agent actually connects to is decided by that agent's `agents.<alias>.mcp_bundles`, and the model is secure by default: omission is not a grant.

- An agent with no `mcp_bundles` connects to **no** MCP servers, even when `mcp.servers` is non-empty.
- A bundle `[mcp_bundles.<alias>]` names the servers it grants by their `mcp.servers` `name`, with an optional `exclude` list. An agent's grant is the union of the servers across every bundle it references, minus any name excluded by any of those bundles (deny wins).
- An unknown bundle alias, or a bundle server name that matches no configured server, grants nothing. Both fail closed and are reported as non-fatal warnings by config validation, so a typo narrows an agent's access instead of widening it.

```toml
[[mcp.servers]]
name = "filesystem"
command = "npx"

[mcp_bundles.files]
servers = ["filesystem"]

[agents.assistant]
mcp_bundles = ["files"]   # connects to `filesystem`; an agent without this gets no MCP servers
```

- Bundle changes take effect on **session restart**. The resolver (`Config::mcp_servers_for_agent`) runs at session/agent construction time; editing `[mcp_bundles.*]` or `agents.<alias>.mcp_bundles` while a session is live does not change that session's connected servers. End and restart the affected sessions to pick up new grants.

This is the *connection* boundary (which servers an agent talks to at all). The `allowed_tools` / `excluded_tools` controls below are the per-tool *capability* boundary applied on top of whatever a granted server exposes.

## Transports

A server is reached over one of three transports (the `transport` field):

| Transport | When to use | Required fields |
|---|---|---|
| `stdio` (default) | A local process you spawn (a Node.js or Python MCP server) | `command`, optional `args`, `env` |
| `http` | A remote server speaking MCP over HTTP POST | `url`, optional `headers` |
| `sse` | A remote server speaking MCP over HTTP + Server-Sent Events | `url`, optional `headers` |

`env` (stdio) and `headers` (http/sse) are stored as secrets; `headers` commonly carries the `Authorization: Bearer …` token for the upstream server.

Add a server through the gateway, zerocode, or `zeroclaw config set` (for example `zeroclaw config set mcp.servers.filesystem.command npx`). A stdio server needs `command` plus optional `args`/`env`; an http/sse server needs `url` plus optional `headers`. The per-field commands are in the field table below.

## Editing servers

Three surfaces edit the same `[[mcp.servers]]` table:

- **`config.toml`**: hand-edit the keys documented below. The full table is round-tripped on save.
- **zerocode TUI** (`/config` -> `mcp.servers`): first-class per-field editor. The section shows one row per server, labeled with the server's `name`; enter a row to edit `transport`, `command` / `url`, `headers`, `env`, and `tool_timeout_secs` as individual fields. `+ Add` creates a new entry seeded with the name you supply; deleting from the alias list removes the entry. The `name` field is not edited inline because renaming the natural key mid-edit would invalidate in-flight references; use the dashboard or hand-edit `config.toml` to rename for now.
- **Web dashboard**: currently renders `mcp.servers` through a JSON-array editor. A migration to the same per-field surface the TUI uses is planned; until then the dashboard remains a usable but coarser editor.

## Server fields

Per-server fields (`[[mcp.servers]]`), generated from the schema:

{{#config-fields mcp.servers}}

`tool_timeout_secs` is an optional per-call timeout; it must be greater than 0 and is capped at 600 seconds.

## Top-level fields

{{#config-fields mcp}}

## Deferred loading

`mcp.deferred_loading` is `false` by default, so configured MCP tools are included in the model context eagerly. Set it to `true` to place only MCP tool **names** in the system prompt; the LLM calls the built-in `tool_search` tool to fetch a tool's full schema before invoking it. This keeps the initial context window small when a server exposes many tools.

## Security and approval

MCP tool calls go through the same approval gate as every other tool, governed by the agent's risk profile (`risk_profiles.<alias>`). The `tool_search` discovery step is auto-approved so deferred MCP loading can work in non-interactive sessions, but tools discovered from MCP servers still follow the normal approval policy:

- At autonomy `level = full`, no tool call prompts (MCP tools included).
- Otherwise, an MCP tool call prompts for approval unless its **prefixed** name (`<server>__<tool>`) is in the profile's `auto_approve` list. `auto_approve = ["*"]` approves everything; an exact entry like `auto_approve = ["filesystem__read_file"]` approves just that tool.
- `always_ask` is the inverse: a name (or `"*"`) there always prompts, overriding `auto_approve`.

### Authorization: `allowed_tools` / `excluded_tools`

Approval gates *when* a tool call needs a human green-light. Authorization gates *whether* the agent can call a tool at all. The two are independent.

Keep the three MCP tool controls on their own axes:

| Control | Scope | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `tool_filter_groups` | Prompt/context exposure | Decide which MCP tool schemas are visible to the model for a turn. |
| `auto_approve` / `always_ask` | Approval policy | Decide whether a selected MCP tool call requires operator approval. |
| `allowed_tools` / `excluded_tools` | Capability policy | Decide which prefixed tool names the risk profile may use at all. |

For runtime-discovered MCP tools the capability contract has an MCP-specific exception:

- If the risk profile's `allowed_tools` is empty or omitted, no authorization constraint applies; every discovered tool (MCP or built-in) is reachable. The TOML config does not distinguish an omitted field from `allowed_tools = []`; both deserialize to the same "no authorization constraint" state at the risk-profile level. If you need an explicit deny-all gate, do it on the caller-supplied per-run `allowed_tools` (cron jobs and other narrowers pass that list in directly) or via `excluded_tools` covering the specific tools you want blocked.
- If `allowed_tools` is non-empty, any MCP tool whose name contains `__` (the `<server>__<tool>` convention) is auto-admitted into the effective allow-list without being listed there individually. Non-MCP built-ins still need an exact entry.
- `excluded_tools` always subtracts, including from the auto-admitted MCP set. To block a single MCP tool like `filesystem__write_file` while keeping the rest of the `filesystem` server reachable, put it in `excluded_tools`.

The rationale: before this exception, every agent that pinned an `allowed_tools` list to lock down its built-in surface would silently lose every MCP tool, even ones the operator explicitly configured. The cost is that the deny-list is now the operator's primary lever for blocking destructive MCP capabilities under an allow-list-pinned profile.

If you want the strict pattern from before this change, where you only admit MCP tools you list explicitly with no `__` auto-admit, combine an explicit `allowed_tools` entry with an `excluded_tools` entry per destructive sibling you need blocked:

```toml
[risk_profiles.assistant]
allowed_tools = [
  "file_read",
  "filesystem__read_file",
]
# Block the destructive sibling that would otherwise be auto-admitted via
# the `__` exception above.
excluded_tools = [
  "filesystem__write_file",
]
auto_approve = [
  "filesystem__read_file",
]
```

The MCP `__` auto-admit exception is scoped to the **risk profile**'s `allowed_tools` only. Caller-supplied per-run allow-lists, like a cron job `allowed_tools` or any other narrowed invocation that passes an explicit list into the runtime, are still treated as strict explicit-list intersections, with no `__` auto-admit on top. A cron job that narrows itself to `allowed_tools = ["cron_add"]` will not surface `filesystem__write_file` to the model even when the agent's risk profile would otherwise auto-admit it via the `__` convention; the per-run narrowing remains a reliable capability boundary regardless of how many MCP servers are configured.

`auto_approve` alone does not hide a tool from the model; it only answers the approval question after the model selects that tool. Use `tool_filter_groups` to reduce prompt noise and `allowed_tools` / `excluded_tools` to enforce a capability boundary.

See [Autonomy levels](../security/autonomy.md) for the full per-profile field surface, and the [Config reference](../reference/config.md#mcp) for every MCP field and default.

## MCP Resources and Prompts

In addition to MCP **tools**, ZeroClaw exposes MCP **resources** and **prompts**
from connected servers.

### Tools

Two built-in tools are available (subject to your agent's tool access policy):

- `mcp_resources`: `action: "list"` (optional `server`, `cursor`) lists
  resources; `action: "read"` with `uri` (prefixed `<server>__<uri>`) returns
  contents.
- `mcp_prompts`: `action: "list"` lists prompts; `action: "get"` with `name`
  (prefixed `<server>__<name>`) and optional `arguments` returns the rendered
  prompt messages.

Servers that do not advertise resource/prompt capabilities are skipped, and calls
against them return a clear "does not support" error.

### Pinning resources into context

Each MCP server entry accepts an optional `pinned_resources` field: a list of
resource URIs to read once at startup and inject into the system prompt. Set it
through the same config surfaces used to define the server (the gateway, zerocode,
or `zeroclaw config set`, as shown under [Configure MCP](#configure-mcp)), naming
the resources you want the agent to always have on hand. The field defaults to
empty, so servers without it are unaffected.

Pinned content is read once per run (no live refresh) and is labeled
`trust="untrusted-external"` so the model treats it as data, not instructions.

### Security

Resource and prompt content originates from the configured MCP server and is
treated as **untrusted**: it is provenance-wrapped, secret-scrubbed, and
length-bounded before entering context. Access to `mcp_resources` / `mcp_prompts`
and to specific servers is governed by your agent's tool access policy (risk
profile), and narrows correctly when delegating to subagents.
