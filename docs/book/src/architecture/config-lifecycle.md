# Config lifecycle

Configuration is both an operator interface and a runtime contract. Treat it as
state with a clear owner, not as loose settings copied into whichever subsystem
needs them.

The canonical source is `zeroclaw_config::schema::Config`, loaded from
`config.toml`. User-facing config surfaces, the generated config reference, the
gateway config editor, env-var overrides, `zeroclaw config set`,
`zeroclaw config patch`, Quickstart, and RPC config methods all route through
that same typed schema.

## What owns what

| Surface | Owner | Persistence boundary | Runtime apply boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Config schema | `crates/zeroclaw-config/src/schema.rs` plus `Configurable` derives | Code, not generated docs | New binary build |
| Generated reference | `cargo mdbook refs` / `markdown-schema` | `docs/book/src/reference/config.md` at build time | Documentation only |
| Bootstrap location | `ZEROCLAW_CONFIG_DIR`, `ZEROCLAW_DATA_DIR`, deprecated `ZEROCLAW_WORKSPACE` | Environment only | Before `Config` exists |
| Schema-mirror overrides | `ZEROCLAW_<lowercase_path>` with `__` for dots | In-memory only | Each `Config::load_or_init()` |
| CLI config writes | `zeroclaw config set`, `config patch`, aliases, model helpers | `save_dirty()` to `config.toml` | Next load/reload unless the current command uses the new in-memory value |
| RPC and TUI config writes | `config/*` RPC methods used by zerocode | `save_dirty()` to `config.toml` | RPC context updates immediately; daemon-owned subsystems need reload |
| Quickstart apply | Shared web, CLI, and zerocode apply path | `save_dirty()` to `config.toml` | Web and RPC can signal daemon reload; standalone CLI applies on next load/reload |
| Gateway config writes | Config API handlers and `persist_and_swap()` | `save_dirty()` to `config.toml` | Gateway-visible state updates immediately; daemon subsystems apply after reload |
| Daemon reload | `/admin/reload`, RPC `config/reload`, or the in-process reload channel | Re-reads `config.toml` | Recreates daemon subsystems in the same PID |

Do not hand-edit the generated config reference. If a field, enum, alias
section, secret marker, or description is wrong there, fix the schema or the
generator and regenerate the reference.

## Load order

Config load has a few distinct phases:

1. Resolve the install root from bootstrap env vars. This happens before any
   `Config` exists, so bootstrap names keep their uppercase form and do not use
   the schema-mirror grammar.
2. Read `config.toml`, run schema migration in memory, decrypt configured
   secrets, and record any malformed security-critical sections as degraded
   security.
3. Apply schema-mirror overrides to the in-memory config. In env vars,
   `__` maps to `.`, so `ZEROCLAW_providers__models__openai__api_key`
   targets `providers.models.openai.api_key`.
4. Validate and warn without locking the operator out of the gateway editor.

On a fresh install, defaults are saved before env overrides are applied. This
keeps env-injected secrets and local CI values out of the new file.

## Env overrides are not saved

Schema-mirror env vars are runtime injections. They land on the in-memory
`Config` at load time and are tracked in `env_overridden_paths` so the CLI,
dashboard, and quickstart can show the override marker.

Saving must mask these paths back to their pre-override disk or default value
before encryption. This matters most for secrets: if an operator has an
encrypted on-disk API key and temporarily boots with an env override for the
same path, an unrelated config save must not replace the real credential with
the env value or with a masked display string.

Review config changes with this invariant in mind:

- `ZEROCLAW_*` schema-mirror values affect the running process after load.
- They do not become durable config.
- Save paths must preserve encrypted secrets and external secret references
  unless the same path was intentionally edited.

## Dirty paths and incremental writes

Most editing surfaces use `Config::mark_dirty()` plus `save_dirty()`, not a
full rewrite. `save_dirty()` writes only changed dotted paths, preserves
non-dirty entries and comments where possible, stamps the current
`schema_version`, and writes through an atomic temp-file replacement.

That path is also responsible for map-key sections. Creating an alias such as a
model provider, MCP server, skill bundle, or knowledge bundle must dirty the
right section so the alias survives a save and reload. A config edit that only
updates the in-memory dashboard state is not complete.

When reviewing a config write, check that:

- the edited path is marked dirty before persistence;
- map-key creates, renames, and deletes dirty the parent section or natural key;
- secret and env-overridden paths keep their save masking behavior;
- `schema_version` remains current after incremental writes;
- the changed value survives `save_dirty()` followed by reload.

## Saved vs applied

A successful save means the file changed. It does not always mean every runtime
component has adopted the change.

The daemon owns the long-lived subsystem graph: gateway, channel listeners,
scheduler, MQTT listener, session wiring, memory backend, provider factories,
and cost wiring. `POST /admin/reload` signals the daemon loop, which re-reads
`config.toml` and re-instantiates those subsystems in the same process. The PID
stays the same, but listeners briefly rebind.

Gateway config writes call `persist_and_swap()`: save to disk, then replace the
gateway-visible in-memory config and set `pending_reload`. This makes the config
editor reflect the write immediately, while the reload banner tells the operator
that channels, providers, scheduler, or other daemon-owned components may still
be running from the previous subsystem instance.

Standalone `zeroclaw gateway start` has no daemon supervisor. Its reload
endpoint returns a restart-required response because there is no outer daemon
loop to signal.

## Reload access

Local reload is allowed from loopback. Remote reload requires both:

1. `gateway.allow_remote_admin = true`
2. pairing enabled and a valid paired bearer token

Opting into remote admin while pairing is disabled is rejected rather than
treated as anonymous remote reload access.

Security-critical malformed config sections are allowed to degrade only when
the operator explicitly opts into degraded serving. Otherwise the process
refuses to serve because reset-to-default security posture may be weaker than
the file intended.

## Rollback and repair

Config writes use an atomic temp-file replacement and owner-only permissions.
When replacing an existing file, the writer creates a same-directory
`config.toml.bak` during the replace and removes it after a successful write.
Gateway writes also snapshot the pre-write file and best-effort restore it if
persistence fails before swapping in-memory state.

There is no general transactional rollback for a valid but undesired config
change after it has been saved and applied. Restore the previous `config.toml`
from backup, edit the field back through the CLI or dashboard, then reload or
restart according to the runtime boundary above.

## Config-visible is not always runtime-supported

A field can be schema-visible before every runtime path consumes it. That is
acceptable only when the docs and review notes say so plainly.

For example, `knowledge_bundles` is schema-visible and appears in config
section APIs. A PR that adds or changes such a surface must be precise about
whether it only stores configuration, wires the runtime behavior, or completes
both.

When reviewing a PR that touches a schema-visible but not yet runtime-consumed
field, require the PR description to say whether runtime wiring is deferred, out
of scope, or completed by the same change.

## Reviewer checklist

For config-schema, env-var, default, or reload changes, ask:

- What is the source of truth for the new value?
- Is this creating duplicate state, or resolving from `Config` at use time?
- Does the generated reference come from code rather than hand-maintained
  prose?
- Are env overrides load-time only and masked during saves?
- Do CLI, gateway, RPC/TUI, and quickstart surfaces agree on the dotted path?
- Does a save survive process reload, not just immediate in-memory rendering?
- Does the PR say whether users need reload, restart, migration, or manual
  rollback?
- If the field is only config-visible, does the PR avoid claiming runtime
  support?
