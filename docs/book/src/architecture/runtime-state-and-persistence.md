# Runtime state and persistence

ZeroClaw has one install root, but not one monolithic "workspace database".
Different state surfaces have different owners, reload behavior, and durability.
Use this map when a change adds state, moves state, caches config, touches reload,
or changes session/memory/log/cost behavior.

The single-source-of-truth rule still applies: if a fact already lives in one
surface, do not copy it into another stored field. Store new state only when this
table identifies the owning surface, or resolve it from the canonical owner at
use time.

## Install layout

For a normal install, `<install>` is the resolved config directory
(`~/.zeroclaw/` by default, Homebrew and explicit `--config-dir` installs can
move it). The current layout is:

```text
<install>/
├── config.toml                 # canonical user config
├── .secret_key                 # key for encrypted secrets
├── data/                       # instance-wide runtime data
│   ├── sessions/
│   │   ├── sessions.db         # default chat/session backend
│   │   └── acp-sessions.db     # ACP protocol sessions
│   ├── cron/jobs.db            # scheduled job state
│   ├── state/
│   │   ├── runtime-trace.jsonl # persisted logs
│   │   └── costs.jsonl         # cost ledger
│   ├── devices.db              # paired-device metadata
│   └── memory/                 # shared instance memory stores
├── shared/                     # shared resources, such as skill bundles
└── agents/<alias>/workspace/   # per-agent filesystem sandbox and identity
```

The legacy `<install>/workspace/` name is still accepted during migration, but
new runtime state should be described in terms of `<install>/data/`,
`<install>/shared/`, and per-agent workspaces.

## State map

| Surface | Canonical source | Durable path | In-memory owner | Reload / concurrency boundary | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Config values | `zeroclaw-config::Config` loaded from `config.toml` | `<install>/config.toml` | daemon `Arc<RwLock<Config>>` plus per-subsystem resolved views | `/admin/reload` re-reads config and re-instantiates daemon subsystems; direct config writes use schema validation and dirty-path checks | Do not cache config-derived facts in long-lived structs unless the cache is explicitly rebuilt on reload. |
| Encrypted secrets | Config secret fields plus `.secret_key` | `<install>/config.toml`, `<install>/.secret_key` | secret-store helpers in `zeroclaw-config` | Reload observes changed config; losing `.secret_key` makes encrypted config secrets unrecoverable | Never copy decrypted values into logs, docs, PR bodies, or runtime metadata. |
| Agent filesystem identity | Per-agent workspace files | `<install>/agents/<alias>/workspace/` | effective `SecurityPolicy` and agent prompt construction | Created lazily when the agent starts; workspace access is evaluated from config | This is the filesystem sandbox, not the config source of truth for providers/channels/tools. |
| Shared skill bundles | Configured skill bundle entries and resolved bundle dirs | `<install>/shared/skills/<bundle>/` by default | skill loading / prompt enrichment | Reload and new agent starts observe config and filesystem changes | Bundle aliases and directory resolution come from config; the files are the bundle content. |
| Conversation memory | `zeroclaw-memory` backend selected per agent | SQLite/Postgres/Lucid/Qdrant/Markdown backend locations; SQLite shared store lives under `data/memory/` | `Arc<dyn Memory>` wrapped in agent-scoping adapters | Backend choice is locked once an agent has written data; same-backend cross-agent recall is opt-in | Memory rows are agent-scoped. Do not replace memory ownership with copied prompt/session caches. |
| Chat and channel sessions | `[channels].session_backend` plus `SessionBackend` | Default `data/sessions/sessions.db`; legacy/explicit JSONL uses `data/sessions/*.jsonl` | `zeroclaw-infra` session backend shared by channels, gateway, RPC tools | SQLite backend uses WAL; `SessionActorQueue` serializes active turns per session | Chat/Code sessions use this unified backend. ACP protocol sessions use a separate store. |
| ACP sessions | ACP protocol session store | `data/sessions/acp-sessions.db` | `AcpSessionStore` opened at daemon boot and in RPC context | WAL-backed SQLite store, separate from chat sessions | ACP `session/load` and `session/resume` operate on this protocol store, not the chat session backend. |
| Live RPC/TUI sessions | RPC `SessionStore` | none by itself | `crates/zeroclaw-runtime/src/rpc/session.rs` in-memory map | Process-local; session history persists only through the chat or ACP backend | Live session handles, uploads, cancel tokens, owners, and overrides are runtime state. |
| Cron jobs | Declarative config membership plus cron SQLite store | `data/cron/jobs.db` | `zeroclaw-runtime::cron` scheduler/store | Read paths do not create `jobs.db`; scheduler owns due/lock state | Declarative jobs are reconciled from config, while run metadata and locks live in the cron DB. |
| Runtime logs | `zeroclaw-log` event schema and subscriber layer | `data/state/runtime-trace.jsonl` when persistence is enabled | broadcast hook, JSONL writer, `/api/logs` reader, `Observer` bridge | Rolling/full/none persistence is config-controlled; dashboard SSE receives events even when JSONL is disabled | Logs are evidence and observability, not the source of user config or session state. |
| Cost ledger | `CostTracker` plus rate config | `data/state/costs.jsonl` | process-global `CostTracker` | Reload hot-swaps `CostConfig`; the tracker is constructed on demand if cost tracking becomes enabled | Existing records keep their recorded price; rate edits affect future requests after reload. |
| Gateway pairing tokens | `PairingGuard` from `gateway.paired_tokens` | token hashes in config | pairing guard | Reload reconstructs the guard from config | Valid bearer tokens are config state, not `devices.db` rows. |
| Paired device metadata | Device registry rows keyed by token hash | `data/devices.db` | `DeviceRegistry` cache plus SQLite | Registry reconciles metadata against the canonical paired-token set | This DB makes paired devices visible/manageable; it does not invent valid tokens. |
| Health and component status | running subsystems report component state | none | gateway health/status state | Process-local; reset/rebuilt on daemon restart or reload | `/health`, `/api/health`, and `/api/status` are current observations, not durable configuration. |
| Queues, debouncers, watchdogs | `zeroclaw-infra` process utilities | none unless a caller stores results elsewhere | in-memory queues/debouncers/watchdogs | Process-local; used to serialize, coalesce, or detect stalls | Treat these as coordination state. Persist only the domain data they protect, not the queue itself. |

## Reload and restart

`POST /admin/reload` sends an in-process reload signal to the daemon. The outer
daemon loop re-reads config from disk and re-runs the daemon, creating fresh
gateway, channel, heartbeat, scheduler, MQTT, session, memory, and cost wiring
from the new config. The PID stays the same, but listeners briefly rebind.

A full process restart also rotates process-local state such as live RPC
sessions, health snapshots, actor queues, and any ephemeral tool-receipt key.
Durable stores survive restart according to the table above.

## Backup and restore

For a normal single-instance install, back up the whole `<install>` directory.
At minimum, include:

- `config.toml`
- `.secret_key` if encrypted secrets are used
- `data/memory/`
- `data/sessions/`
- `data/cron/jobs.db` if cron jobs are configured through runtime surfaces
- `data/state/costs.jsonl` if cost history matters
- `data/state/runtime-trace.jsonl` if logs are needed for incident review
- `data/devices.db` for paired-device metadata

Do not run two daemons against the same install root. Several stores use SQLite
with a single-writer model, and the process-local caches assume one daemon owns
the instance.
