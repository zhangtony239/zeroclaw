# Logging architecture

ZeroClaw has exactly one logging surface: the `zeroclaw_log::record!` macro. Every emission in the workspace, agent loop activity, channel I/O, cron runs, tool calls, memory ops, session lifecycle, errors, flows through it. The macro fires a `tracing` event that the installed subscriber feeds to two sibling layers: the stderr fmt layer (terminal output) and the `LogCaptureLayer`. The fmt layer prints colored, alias-prefixed lines on stderr (muted unless `--verbose`). The `LogCaptureLayer` materializes a structured `LogEvent` and fans it out, via `writer::record_event`, to:

1. The Observer bridge (`observer_bridge::forward`) for Prometheus / OTel typed metrics.
2. The process-wide broadcast channel so the dashboard's SSE stream sees every event live.
3. The persisted JSONL log at `<workspace>/state/runtime-trace.jsonl` (when `[observability] log_persistence` is `"rolling"`, `"full"`, or `"rotating"`).

The on-disk JSONL append happens last and only when persistence is enabled; the Observer bridge and broadcast hook fire unconditionally.

## Read this first: attribution is not attrs

Every log event carries two completely separate channels of structured data. Confusing them is the single most common mistake at a call site, so internalize the split before anything else:

| | **Attribution** (`zeroclaw.*`) | **Attrs** (`attributes.*`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Answers** | *Who* did it and *under what context* | *What* specifically happened |
| **Examples** | `channel`, `agent_alias`, `model_provider`, `tool`, `session_key`, `cron_job_id` | `bytes_received`, `tokens_used`, `status_code`, error payloads |
| **Source** | **Spans.** Opened at entry points, walked by the layer. | **The call site.** `Event::with_attrs(json!({...}))`. |
| **Appears at the call site?** | **Never.** Not a `record!` argument. | Yes, that's the only place it can come from. |

The rule that falls out of this: **if a value identifies who or what scope an event belongs to, it comes from a span and must never appear at the call site.** Attribution flows in automatically from `attribution_span!` / `scope!` wrappers opened higher up the stack; the layer walks the span scope leaf→root when an event fires and merges every contribution into the event's `zeroclaw.*` block. The call site that fires `record!` names none of it.

Because attribution is the load-bearing half of this split and the half that trips people up, it comes first.

## Attribution: it all comes from spans

**Attribution is never a call-site argument.** Read that again. Channel composite, agent_alias, model_provider, tool, session_key, cron_job_id: none of these are ever typed into a `record!` call. They flow in through tracing spans opened at entry points and walked by the layer when an event fires. If you find yourself wanting to pass `agent_alias` or `tool` to `record!`, stop: the value is already in scope through a span, or it should be, and the fix is to open or fix the span, not to thread the value into the call site.

The mechanism, end to end:

1. A "thing" (channel, provider, agent, tool, cron job, memory backend, …) implements `Attributable` once, next to its struct.
2. Its entry point wraps work in `attribution_span!(self)`, which opens a tracing span carrying that thing's role and alias.
3. Every `record!` fired anywhere inside that span, directly or nested arbitrarily deep, inherits the attribution automatically.
4. When the event fires, the layer walks the span scope **leaf→root**, merges every `Attributable`'s contribution, and writes the merged `zeroclaw.*` block. The call site named none of it.

This is the whole point of the design: per-thing logging code is zero. You impl the trait once and wrap the entry point once; every emission underneath is attributed for free.

### The `Attributable` trait

Lives in `crates/zeroclaw-api/src/attribution.rs` so every crate can implement it without depending on `zeroclaw-log`:

```rust
pub trait Attributable {
    fn role(&self) -> Role;
    fn alias(&self) -> &str;
}
```

Each "thing" in the workspace (a `TelegramChannel`, an `AnthropicModelProvider`, an `Agent`, a cron job, a tool, a memory backend, a peer group, a skill bundle, an MCP bundle, a session) impls `Attributable` once next to its struct.

### The `Role` taxonomy

Closed nested enum:

```rust
pub enum Role {
    Swarm,
    Agent,
    Channel(ChannelKind),       // Telegram, Discord, Slack, Matrix, Lark, ...
    Tool(ToolKind),             // Shell, HttpRequest, FetchUrl, ...
    Cron(CronKind),             // Interval, At, Cron, Once
    Provider(ProviderKind),     // Model, Tts, Transcription, Tunnel
    Memory(MemoryKind),         // Sqlite, Json, InMemory, Markdown, Qdrant, ...
    PeerGroup,
    Skill,
    Mcp,
    Sop,
    Session,
    System,
}
```

`ChannelKind`, `ToolKind`, `CronKind`, `MemoryKind`, and the four `ProviderKind` sub-enums (`ModelProviderKind`, `TtsProviderKind`, `TranscriptionProviderKind`, `TunnelProviderKind`) are all closed. The variant's snake_case form via `strum::IntoStaticStr` is the canonical `<type>` portion of the `<type>.<alias>` composite. Adding a new implementation: extend the relevant `Kind` enum, that's it.

### Opening a span, do this at every entry point

Wrap an entry-point's work with `attribution_span!(thing)`. The macro returns a `Span` carrying the thing's role and alias as structured fields. `.instrument(span)` the future (or `let _g = span.entered()` in sync code). **A spawned task that does not re-establish the span loses attribution**: every `tokio::spawn` body that emits must carry the same `attribution_span!` / `scope!` the parent used, or its emissions land un-attributed.

```rust
use zeroclaw_log::Instrument;

let span = zeroclaw_log::attribution_span!(self);  // self impls Attributable
async move {
    // every record! inside automatically carries the alias-bound fields
    record!(INFO, Event::new(module_path!(), Action::Start), "channel online");
    self.poll_loop().await
}.instrument(span).await
```

The layer walks the span scope leaf→root when an event fires, merges every `Attributable`'s contribution into the event's `zeroclaw.*` attribution block, and emits the composite (`channel = "telegram.clamps"`, `channel_type = "telegram"`, `channel_alias = "clamps"`) without the call site naming any of those keys.

### The `scope!` macro, non-role context

`attribution_span!` is for role-bearing `Attributable` things. For per-scope identifiers that aren't tied to one (sender id, message id, turn id, request id), use `scope!`:

```rust
zeroclaw_log::scope!(
    sender: msg.sender.as_str(),
    message_id: msg.id.as_str(),
    => async move { process_message(msg).await }
).await
```

`scope!` straddles the attribution/attrs line deliberately: field keys that match the alias-bound `ATTRIBUTION_FIELDS` / `COMPOSITE_PREFIXES` (in `crates/zeroclaw-log/src/event.rs`) land in the typed `zeroclaw.*` attribution slot; everything else lands in the event `attributes` map for every descendant emission. Either way the value rides on every nested `record!` without being a call-site argument.

## The `record!` macro and its call-site contract

The `tracing` crate is `zeroclaw-log`'s implementation detail: the `record!` / `scope!` / `attribution_span!` macros expand to `zeroclaw_log::__private::tracing` so a call site never names a tracing type. The log-event macros themselves (`tracing::{trace,debug,info,warn,error}`, `log::*`, `std::dbg`, plus bare `anyhow::anyhow!`) are **hard-banned workspace-wide** as `disallowed-macros` in `clippy.toml`. With `-D warnings` in CI, any direct `tracing::info!` etc. **fails the build**, with a clippy message naming `::zeroclaw_log::record!` as the replacement. This is not a convention; it is enforced.

The only exemptions are the few files inside `crates/zeroclaw-log/` that bootstrap the pipeline and carry a local `#![allow(clippy::disallowed_macros)]`. A handful of crates (`zeroclaw-api`, `zeroclaw-spawn`, `zeroclaw-providers`, `zeroclaw-hardware`, `zeroclaw-log`) still list `tracing` / `tracing-subscriber` in `Cargo.toml`, but only for span and subscriber plumbing, not for emitting log macros. The dependency being present does not license calling the banned macros. (`tokio::spawn` is banned the same way via `disallowed-methods`; use `::zeroclaw_spawn::spawn!` so spawned tasks inherit the caller's attribution span.)

The macro is locked-shape: it takes a level, a single `Event` expression, and a message literal.

```rust
use zeroclaw_log::{record, Event, Action, EventCategory, EventOutcome};

record!(INFO, Event::new(module_path!(), Action::Start), "starting step");
record!(WARN, Event::new(module_path!(), Action::Fail).with_outcome(EventOutcome::Failure).with_attrs(serde_json::json!({"exit_code": 137})), "tool failed");
```

`module_path!()` is the canonical source of the event name: it's the Rust module path of the call site (e.g. `zeroclaw_channels::telegram`), so events are searchable, jump-to-source-able, and impossible to typo. The same convention is used at every `record!` site in the workspace.

The macro injects `file!()` and `line!()` automatically. The `LogCaptureLayer` attaches them to the event's `attributes` map as `_file` and `_line` so operators jump to source from a log viewer.

### Call-site contract

Every `record!` call is a single line of code that says **what happened**, not **who did it or under what context**.

- The single positional argument after the level is an `Event` expression.
- The next argument is a string literal for the human-readable message.
- That is everything. Channel, agent_alias, provider, tool, session_key, cron_job_id, model: none of those are call-site arguments. They flow in from spans (see [Attribution: it all comes from spans](#attribution-it-all-comes-from-spans)).

The shape is enforced by the `Event` struct: unknown fields are a compile error.

### When attrs are warranted

`Event::with_attrs(serde_json::json!({...}))` is for per-event measurements and ad-hoc data that exist nowhere in the surrounding scope. Concretely:

- Per-event measurements: `bytes_received`, `tokens_used`, `retry_count`, `status_code`, `queue_depth`.
- Error payloads when the error is the event itself: anyhow chain text, HTTP error body, parse-error details.
- External-system identifiers: a remote API's `request_id`, an upstream trace header.
- Derived state captured at this instant: in-flight count, retry-after seconds.

**Attrs are NOT for** anything that comes from the surrounding scope: channel composite, agent_alias, model_provider, tool, session_key, cron_job_id, sender, message_id, etc. Those belong in a wrapping `attribution_span!` or `scope!`.

The serde rule: pass the **raw value**, never `format!("{}", v)` or `format!("{:?}", v)`. `serde_json::json!` serializes strings as strings, numbers as numbers, `Vec<T>` as arrays, `Option<T>` as null-or-value. Wrap with `.to_string()` only when the type doesn't `impl Serialize` (e.g. `anyhow::Error`, `reqwest::Error`, `std::io::Error`, `Path::Display`, `StatusCode`).

### Placeholder rule

Rust string-literal placeholders like `"raw error body: {body}"` are forbidden inside `record!` messages. Rust 2021's implicit format-string capture does not flow through `record!`: every `{var}` becomes a literal substring with no substitution. The conversion rule:

```rust
// BAD — {body} is a literal, never interpolated
record!(WARN, Event::new(module_path!(), Action::Fail), "raw error body: {body}");

// GOOD — body in attrs, message is plain prose
record!(WARN, Event::new(module_path!(), Action::Fail).with_attrs(serde_json::json!({"body": body})), "raw error body");
```

## `Event`, `Action`, `EventOutcome`, `EventCategory`

All four are closed enums defined in `crates/zeroclaw-log/src/event.rs`. Adding a value is the only point of change: call sites do not invent strings.

- `Action`: closed verb set, snake-cased on disk via `strum::IntoStaticStr`: `Start`, `Complete`, `Fail`, `Cancel`, `Skip`, `Timeout`, `Retry`, `Inbound`, `Outbound`, `Send`, `Receive`, `Connect`, `Disconnect`, `Reconnect`, `Spawn`, `Kill`, `Tick`, `Trigger`, `Schedule`, `Approve`, `Reject`, `Defer`, `Read`, `Write`, `Delete`, `List`, `Query`, `Invoke`, `Dispatch`, `Resolve`, `Register`, `Unregister`, `Load`, `Save`, `Migrate`, `Validate`, `Note`.
- `EventOutcome`: `Success`, `Failure`, `Unknown`. `Unknown` is the default and is skipped on serialization (omitted from the on-disk `event.outcome`), so a row with no `outcome` key is implicitly `Unknown`.
- `EventCategory`: `Agent`, `Channel`, `Cron`, `Memory`, `Tool`, `Provider`, `Session`, `System`, `Internal`. Derived from the innermost role span unless overridden via `Event::with_category(...)`.

## Tool input/output propagation

The central tool executor (`crates/zeroclaw-runtime/src/agent/tool_execution.rs::execute_one_tool`) wraps every `Tool::execute(args)` call with invoke/complete/fail events. Each event's name is `module_path!()` (the executor's own module), not a hardcoded string; the `Action` and severity distinguish them:

1. Before running: `record!(DEBUG, Event::new(module_path!(), Action::Invoke).with_category(EventCategory::Tool).with_attrs(...))` with `tool`, `tool_call_id`, and the full `input` in attrs.
2. Runs `execute(args).await`.
3. On success (`r.success`): `record!(DEBUG, ... Action::Complete)` with `Outcome::Success`, the duration, and `tool` / `tool_call_id` / `input` / `output` in attrs.
4. On tool-reported failure (`!r.success`): `record!(WARN, ... Action::Fail)` with `Outcome::Failure`, the duration, and `tool` / `tool_call_id` / `input` / `error` / `output` in attrs.
5. On `Err` from `execute`: `record!(ERROR, ... Action::Fail)` with `Outcome::Failure`, the duration, and the debug-formatted error in attrs.

These events are emitted inside a `scope!`-style span (`target = "zeroclaw_log_internal_scope"`, field `tool = <name>`) opened around the call, so the `tool` field rides on every descendant emission too. Per-tool `Tool::execute` impls add zero logging code.

## `LogCaptureLayer` and the on-disk schema

The layer in `crates/zeroclaw-log/src/layer.rs` is a `tracing-subscriber` Layer that:

1. On span creation/record with target `"zeroclaw_log_internal_attribution"` (the target the `attribution_span!` macro opens with): parses the role + alias fields into a `ZeroclawAttribution` snapshot stored on the span's extensions.
2. On span creation/record with target `"zeroclaw_log_internal_scope"` (`scope!`-opened): parses ad-hoc kvps and stashes them similarly.
3. On event emission with target `"zeroclaw_log_event"` (the target the `record!` macro fires through): builds a `LogEvent` from the `zc_*` field set, walks the span scope leaf→root merging every attribution snapshot it finds, parses the `zc_attrs` JSON blob into the event `attributes`, attaches `_file`/`_line` from auto-captured source location, and hands the final event to `writer::record_event`, which fans out in this order:
   - Observer bridge (`observer_bridge.rs`) for Prometheus / OTel typed metrics (unconditional).
   - Broadcast hook (`broadcast.rs`) for SSE/dashboard subscribers (unconditional).
   - JSONL persistence (`writer.rs`), appended last and only when `log_persistence` is enabled.

The on-disk JSON shape (`LogEvent` in `event.rs`):

```json
{
  "id": "<uuid>",
  "@timestamp": "2026-05-16T10:08:59.002Z",
  "severity_number": 9,
  "severity_text": "INFO",
  "event": { "category": "channel", "action": "inbound", "outcome": "success" },
  "service": { "name": "zeroclaw", "version": "0.8.2" },
  "trace_id": "<turn id>",
  "span_id": "<sub-span id>",
  "zeroclaw": {
    "channel": "telegram.clamps",
    "channel_type": "telegram",
    "channel_alias": "clamps",
    "agent_alias": "clamps",
    "model_provider": "anthropic.clamps",
    "model_provider_type": "anthropic",
    "model_provider_alias": "clamps",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6"
  },
  "message": "inbound message",
  "attributes": { "sender": "...", "_file": "...", "_line": 42 },
  "schema_version": 2
}
```

`@timestamp` is `chrono::DateTime<Utc>` serialized as RFC 3339 with `Z`. The schema version is `2`; older `version: 1` rows are migrated in place at daemon startup by `migrate::migrate_legacy_jsonl_in_place`.

## `LogConfig` vs `ObservabilityConfig`

`zeroclaw-log` defines its own minimal `LogConfig` (in `crates/zeroclaw-log/src/config.rs`): `log_persistence`, `log_persistence_path`, `log_persistence_max_entries`, `log_persistence_max_bytes`, `log_persistence_rotate_daily`, `log_persistence_retention_max_files`, `log_persistence_retention_max_age_days`, `log_tool_io`, `log_tool_io_truncate_bytes`, `log_tool_io_denylist`. This breaks what would otherwise be a dep cycle: `zeroclaw-config::ObservabilityConfig` carries the full schema (with TOML deserialization and validation), and the runtime converts to `LogConfig` at startup via `crates/zeroclaw-runtime/src/observability/runtime_trace.rs::to_log_config`. The result: `zeroclaw-config` can `record!` without inverting the dep tree.

## Subscriber installation

The daemon installs the global subscriber via:

```rust
zeroclaw_log::install_global_subscriber(
    recording_filter.as_deref(),   // Option<&str> — the --log-level flag, if set
    &default_filter,               // &str — fallback filter when no flag and no RUST_LOG
    cli.verbose,                   // bool — gates the stderr fmt (terminal) layer
);
```

Two independent axes: the **recording floor** (what reaches `LogCaptureLayer`, resolved as flag → `RUST_LOG` → default) and **terminal display** (the stderr fmt layer, muted entirely unless `verbose` is true). That single call sets up the agent-alias-prefixed terminal formatter + the `LogCaptureLayer` over a `tracing-subscriber::Registry`. `src/main.rs` is the only place that calls it. Tests use `zeroclaw_log::try_install_capture_subscriber()` + `zeroclaw_log::subscribe_or_install()` to drain emitted events through the broadcast hook without any tracing types named in the test crate.

## When to extend the closed enums

- **New channel impl**: add a variant to `ChannelKind`. The snake_case form is the on-disk `channel_type` string. Add `#[strum(serialize = "...")]` only when the variant name doesn't snake-case to the desired value (e.g. `OpenAi` → `"openai"`).
- **New tool impl** (workspace built-in): add to `ToolKind`.
- **New cron schedule shape**: add to `CronKind`.
- **New model / TTS / transcription / tunnel provider**: add to the relevant `*ProviderKind` sub-enum under `ProviderKind`.
- **New memory backend**: add to `MemoryKind`.
- **New `Role` family altogether** (PeerGroup / Skill / Mcp gain sub-types): nest with its own `Kind` on the fly: the pattern is uniform.

Then add `impl Attributable for X` next to the new struct (`fn role() -> Role::Family(Kind::Variant)`, `fn alias() -> &str { &self.alias }`) and wrap its entry point with `attribution_span!(self)`. The layer picks up everything else automatically.
