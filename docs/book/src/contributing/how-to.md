# How to Contribute

We accept code, docs, bug reports, and feedback from anyone willing to file them clearly. This page covers the mechanics: how to get a change in, what we look for in review, and what to expect after you open a PR.

See [Communication](./communication.md) for non-code contributions (reporting issues, feedback, getting help).

See [RFC process](./rfcs.md) for larger changes that need design discussion before implementation.

## Before you start

For anything larger than a typo fix:

1. **Check the issue tracker.** Someone may already be working on it or have filed a related discussion.
2. **Read `AGENTS.md`.** The repo's root `AGENTS.md` is the canonical source of convention: risk tiers, PR discipline, anti-patterns, and review standards live there.
3. **Use the [Architecture and contribution map](./architecture-map.md)** for anything that touches architecture, config, security, workflow, governance, CI, release behavior, or AI-assisted contribution policy.
4. **Pick a branch.** PRs target `master`. Fork the repo and branch from there; there's no develop/integration branch to go through.

## The flow

```
fork → branch → commit → push → open PR → review → merge (squash)
```

The key checkpoints:

- **PR template**: `.github/pull_request_template.md`. Fill it out. The summary, validation evidence, and compatibility sections are non-negotiable.
- **CI**: runs on every PR. `ci.yml` is the composite gate; all legs must pass.
- **Labels**: maintainers use labels to route review depth. You do not need to know every label family before opening a PR. If labels look obviously wrong and you cannot edit them, flag the mismatch in a comment; maintainers or reviewers with label permissions can correct obvious mismatches directly.
- **Review routing**: make the scope, linked issues, validation, and risk/rollback context clear enough that reviewers can choose the right review path quickly.
- **Review**: maintainers review. Findings use the PR review taxonomy: 🔴 blocking, 🟡 warning, 🔵 suggestion, 🟢 praise, and ✅ resolved. Address blockers; warnings should get a response; suggestions are optional.

## Code style

- `cargo fmt` clean (checked in CI)
- `cargo clippy -D warnings` clean (checked in CI)
- No unused production code: delete it, wire it into behavior, or track a follow-up issue. Do not silence it with underscore prefixes or `#[allow(dead_code)]`; reserve underscore names for required but intentionally unused API, trait, or callback parameters.
- Error handling: `anyhow::Result` at binary boundaries, typed errors in library crates. No `unwrap()` / `expect()` in production code paths: propagate with `?` or document the invariant that makes panic impossible.
- Minimal dependencies: every dep adds to binary size; weigh the trade before adding one
- Trait-first: define the trait in `zeroclaw-api`, then implement in the right edge crate
- Security by default: allowlists, not blocklists. New external surface defaults closed
- Inline unit tests: `#[cfg(test)] mod tests {}` at the bottom of the file or a sibling `tests.rs`
- Don't commit secrets, personal data, or real-user identities: the [Privacy & PII discipline](./privacy.md) page is the merge gate

## Testing

- Unit tests co-located with the code (`mod tests`)
- Integration tests in `tests/` and crate-local unit tests: run via `cargo nextest run --locked --workspace --exclude zeroclaw-desktop`
- Feature-gated code needs feature-gated tests
- Don't mock the database for tests that exercise schema or SQL: integration tests must hit a real SQLite

For the full five-level taxonomy (unit / component / integration / system / live), shared mock infrastructure, and JSON trace fixture format, see [Testing](./testing.md).

## Docs changes

- Prose changes go in `docs/book/src/**/*.md` (this mdBook)
- Rustdoc (`///`) changes update the API reference automatically on deploy
- Reference pages (`docs/book/src/reference/cli.md`, `config.md`) are generated; don't hand-edit. Run `cargo mdbook refs` and commit the output
- Localisation: English markdown is the source of truth. Routine English docs PRs may omit broad generated `.po` churn; use the standard PR-body note in [Building the docs locally](../developing/building-docs.md).
- Translation-cache PRs, release translation passes, and new locales should run `cargo mdbook sync`, commit the resulting `.po` files, and validate them with `cargo mdbook check`

## Publishing blog or website metadata

When you publish a blog post or otherwise update the public blog metadata, update the hand-maintained feed timestamps in the same PR:

- `web/public/blog/rss.xml`: set `<lastBuildDate>` to the latest post publish time in RFC 2822 / GMT format
- `web/public/blog/atom.xml`: set `<updated>` to the latest post publish time in ISO 8601 UTC format
- `web/public/sitemap.xml`: set the `/blog` entry's `<lastmod>` to the latest publish date

Keep feed discovery environment-local:

- `web/index.html` should keep `/blog/rss.xml`, `/blog/atom.xml`, and `/sitemap.xml` as root-relative links
- `web/public/sitemap.xml` should list the human-facing `/blog` page, not the XML feed files

## Commit messages

Conventional Commits:

```
feat(providers): add support for DeepSeek reasoning mode
fix(channels/matrix): prevent duplicate device sessions after verify
docs(getting-started): add YOLO-mode quick-start
refactor(runtime): split agent loop into steps
chore: bump tokio to 1.43
```

AI-assisted collaboration is welcome, but do not add bot/AI attribution trailers or generated tool footers to PR bodies or commit-message tails. Human `Co-authored-by:` trailers remain appropriate for incorporated contributor work when they follow the superseding and privacy rules. See FND-005 (Contribution Culture) for the full norm.

## Pull requests

Title mirrors the squash commit:

```
feat(scope): short description
```

Body uses the PR template. **The validation-evidence section is required**: paste the checks that match the change. For docs-only PRs, use `scripts/ci/docs_quality_gate.sh` and `scripts/ci/docs_links_gate.sh` or explain why link checking had no added links to inspect. For Rust/code PRs, include `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, plus whatever manual verification you did. "It works on my machine" is not evidence.

Risk labels:

- `risk:low`: rollback is a revert; no user action needed
- `risk:medium`: users may need to update config / env / CLI usage; rollback plan required
- `risk:high`: security-critical, schema changes, breaking behaviour. Rollback plan, feature flag, and observable failure symptoms required

## After the PR

**Merge strategy:** squash-merge with the full commit history preserved in the body. See `.claude/skills/squash-merge/SKILL.md` for the exact format: TL;DR: PR title + `(#number)` as the subject, bullet list of original commits as the body.

**Release:** changes land on `master`; `master` does not auto-release. A maintainer bumps the version and tags `vX.Y.Z` when a release ships. You'll see your PR in the CHANGELOG.

## Areas that want help

| Area | Where to start |
|---|---|
| New channel | `crates/zeroclaw-channels/`: copy an existing channel of similar shape |
| New provider | `crates/zeroclaw-providers/`: `compatible.rs` covers most OpenAI-like ones |
| Docs | `docs/book/src/`: anything marked outdated or missing |
| Translations | `cargo fluent fill --locale <code>`: see [Maintainers → Docs & Translations](../maintainers/docs-and-translations.md) |
| Hardware | `crates/zeroclaw-hardware/`: new board support, new sensor drivers |

## Code of conduct

Don't be a jerk. Disagree on ideas; not people. Accept that maintainers will close things they don't want to own, usually with an explanation, occasionally without. If a close feels unjustified, ask; if the ask goes nowhere, move on.
