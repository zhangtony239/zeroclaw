# Cost tracking

ZeroClaw records every priced API call to an append-only ledger,
attributes spend to the originating agent, enforces daily / monthly
budgets, and surfaces the rollup on the dashboard `Cost` tab. The
pricing rules live in config so operators can edit them without a
rebuild.

This page describes the schema, the lookup pipeline, and the operator
surfaces. The code lives in `crates/zeroclaw-config/src/cost/` and
`crates/zeroclaw-runtime/src/agent/cost.rs`.

## Config schema

Two related sections own the surface. `cost` covers budget enforcement and recording behavior. `cost.rates.*`
is the operator-managed rate sheet; every subsection's dotted path mirrors
the matching `providers.*` path with the trailing `<alias>` segment
replaced by the upstream resource being priced.

### Why the key is a resource id, not an alias

A `[providers.models.anthropic.<alias>]` entry is keyed by an operator-chosen
alias (`glados`, `production`) that follows the alias validator: lowercase
ASCII, single underscores, no hyphens. A `[cost.rates.providers.models.anthropic.<resource>]`
entry is keyed by the **upstream model id** as it appears in usage telemetry
(`claude-opus-4-7`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `whisper-1`): those id strings come from
the provider's namespace and almost always contain hyphens.

The schema marks every rate-sheet HashMap with `#[resource_key]` (in
`crates/zeroclaw-macros/src/lib.rs`). That attribute opts the field out of
`validate_alias_key` in `create_map_key` / `rename_map_key`, so the
gateway's `POST /api/config/map-key` accepts hyphenated ids. Without it,
`create_map_key` rejects every realistic model id and the rate-sheet UI
falls flat. Aliases and resource ids share the on-disk structure
(`HashMap<String, T>`) but they're different naming systems with different
validators.

### Slot lists are the single source of truth

The per-provider-type slots under `[cost.rates.providers.models.<type>]`,
`[cost.rates.providers.tts.<type>]`, and `[cost.rates.providers.transcription.<type>]`
expand from the same macros that drive the `[providers.*]` slot wrappers:

```rust
// crates/zeroclaw-config/src/providers.rs
for_each_model_provider_slot!(emit_model_cost_rates_struct);
for_each_tts_provider_slot!(emit_tts_cost_rates_struct, super::schema::TtsCostRates);
for_each_transcription_provider_slot!(emit_transcription_cost_rates_struct, super::schema::TranscriptionCostRates);
```

Adding a new model provider type is one row in `for_each_model_provider_slot!`;
the rate-sheet slot, the provider config slot, and the dashboard dropdowns
all expand from it. No hand-typed dispatch tables, no parallel string lists
on the frontend.

## Pricing at request time

The pipeline from `[cost.rates.*]` to a recorded `cost_usd` value is:

1. **Orchestrator startup builds the pricing map.** When the channels
   supervisor instantiates a runtime context for an agent it walks
   `config.cost.rates.providers.models.iter_entries()` and merges the
   rates into a `HashMap<provider_type, HashMap<key, f64>>` where `key`
   is `"<model_id>.input"`, `"<model_id>.output"`, or
   `"<model_id>.cached_input"`. The legacy per-alias
   `[providers.models.<type>.<alias>].pricing` table is merged in too;
   `[cost.rates.*]` wins on conflict because it's the forward-looking
   surface.
   (See `crates/zeroclaw-channels/src/orchestrator/mod.rs`,
   the closure under `cost_tracking: CostTracker::get_or_init_global(...).map(|tracker| ...)`.)

2. **Recording inside the agent loop.** Every successful LLM response
   reaches `record_tool_loop_cost_usage(provider_name, model, usage)`
   in `crates/zeroclaw-runtime/src/agent/cost.rs`. The function pulls
   the pricing map slot for `provider_name`, calls `resolve_rates(map,
   model)`, multiplies by token counts, and stores a `CostRecord` via
   the global `CostTracker`.

3. **resolve_rates** tries the model id first, then the path-suffix
   form for `provider/model` strings (so `anthropic/claude-opus-4-7`
   degrades to `claude-opus-4-7` if the operator stored only the
   short form). Returns `(0.0, 0.0)` on miss and triggers a one-shot
   `missing_pricing` warn so silent zero-cost records show up in logs.

4. **CostTracker is a process-global singleton** (`OnceLock` in
   `crates/zeroclaw-config/src/cost/tracker.rs`). Reload applies the
   latest `CostConfig` to the existing tracker, and if cost tracking
   was disabled at boot, a later reload with `cost.enabled = true`
   constructs the tracker on demand. The orchestrator's pricing map is
   also rebuilt on every daemon reload from the live config, so rate
   edits take effect on the next request after reload.

## Persistence

`CostTracker::record_usage_with_agent` appends one `CostRecord` per
priced response to `<workspace>/state/costs.jsonl`, one JSON object
per line. The file is read on startup to seed `daily_records()` so
the dashboard's per-agent rollup survives restarts.

`cost_usd` is computed at record time from the rate sheet in effect
**at that moment**. Records are immutable: if the operator adds
rates after some requests have already been recorded, those existing
records keep `cost_usd = 0`. Only requests made after the rate is
configured (and the daemon reloaded so the orchestrator's pricing
map rebuilds) carry a non-zero cost.

This is the most common surprise after first enabling the rate sheet.
The fix is to wait for new requests; there's no retroactive repricing.

## Budget enforcement

`CostConfig::enforcement.mode` decides what happens when a projected
cost would push `daily_total` or `monthly_total` past the configured
limit:

- `warn`: the default; record the event with a warn-level log and
  let the request through.
- `block`: refuse the request with a `BudgetExceeded` error.
- `route_down`: substitute `route_down_model` (a cheaper
  alternative) for the original model. The substitution happens before
  the request is dispatched.

`allow_override = true` lets a request bypass `block` by passing an
override token on the CLI (`zeroclaw --override`). Defaults to
`false`. `warn_at_percent` controls when the gateway surfaces a
warning banner ahead of the hard limit; defaults to 80%.

## Per-agent attribution

When `cost.track_per_agent` is true (default) every recorded
`CostRecord` carries the originating agent alias. The dashboard's
**Spend by agent** panel and `GET /api/cost?agent=<alias>` consume
this field. Setting `track_per_agent = false` is an optimization for
high-volume installs where the extra HashMap aggregation shows up in
profiles; the trade-off is losing the per-agent dimension everywhere.

## Operator surfaces

### Config UI

- `/config/cost` → **Limits** tab: every flat `[cost].*` field
  (enabled, limits, enforcement, track_per_agent). Rate-sheet rows
  are not edited here, they're tied to the provider that owns the
  model, so they live one tier down.
- `/config/providers.<category>/<type>` → **Costs** tab: rate-sheet
   editor for that provider type. The `+ Add` input suggests upstream
   resource ids drawn from `providers.<category>.<type>.*.model`
   across configured aliases, so the operator can one-click a rate row
   for every model they've actually bound. This is the only entry
   point for editing `[cost.rates.providers.<category>.<type>.*]`.

### Dashboard

The dashboard's **Cost** tab shows three panels plus a Window picker
(today / last 7 days / last 30 days / this month / all time):

- **Spend totals**: daily and monthly totals from `costs.jsonl`.
- **Spend by agent · `<window>`**: per-agent rollup over the picked
  window. Visible when `track_per_agent` is true.
- **Spend by model · `<window>`**: per-model rollup. Each row's model
  id is clickable; the click resolves the owning provider type from
  configured aliases and navigates to that provider's Costs tab. When
  the model id isn't bound to any configured provider the click is a
  no-op (there's no qualified rate-sheet route for an orphan model).

### Gateway

- `GET /api/cost`: current `CostSummary` (matches the dashboard's
  Cost overview shape). Add `?agent=<alias>` for a single-agent view.
- `GET /api/config/templates`: every map-keyed section the schema
  registers, used by the Rates tab's category × provider-type
  dropdowns.
- `POST /api/config/map-key?path=cost.rates.providers.<category>.<type>&key=<resource>`
  create a new rate row. The path is rejected if no such map
  section exists; the resource key passes `#[resource_key]` instead
  of `validate_alias_key`.

## Troubleshooting

**Dashboard shows $0.0000 for all agents after configuring rates.**
Old records are immutable, they were recorded with `cost_usd = 0`
because no rate was set when they happened. Make a new chat request
after the daemon reload and check **Cost overview > Session** plus
**Spend by model**; both should populate for the new request.

**Drift detected against `cost.rates.*` paths after save.** A pre
v0.8.0 daemon mangled hyphenated HashMap keys in the dirty-save path,
silently dropping every write to the rate sheet. If you see this on
v0.8.0+ it's a real bug: the dirty-path resolution lives in
`crates/zeroclaw-config/src/schema.rs::apply_dirty_path`; file an
issue with the daemon version and the path that drifted.

**`missing_pricing` warns spam the log.** Emitted once per
`(provider_type, model)` pair when `resolve_rates` returns `(0.0,
0.0)`. Either the rate isn't configured for that model, or the
upstream returned a different model id than what's in the rate
sheet (some providers return versioned ids like
`claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` even when you configured
`claude-3-5-sonnet`). Add the exact id the warn names, or set the
unversioned id and rely on `resolve_rates`'s suffix-match path.
