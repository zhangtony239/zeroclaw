# Hardware Peripherals Design: ZeroClaw

ZeroClaw enables microcontrollers (MCUs) and Single Board Computers (SBCs) to **dynamically interpret natural language commands**, generate hardware-specific code, and execute peripheral interactions in real-time.

## 1. Vision

**Goal:** ZeroClaw acts as a hardware-aware AI agent that:
- Receives natural language triggers (e.g. "Move X arm", "Turn on LED") via channels (WhatsApp, Telegram)
- Fetches accurate hardware documentation (datasheets, register maps)
- Synthesizes Rust code/logic using an LLM (Gemini, local open-source models)
- Executes the logic to manipulate peripherals (GPIO, I2C, SPI)
- Persists optimized code for future reuse

**Mental model:** ZeroClaw = brain that understands hardware. Peripherals = arms and legs it controls.

## 2. Two Modes of Operation

### Mode 1: Edge-Native (Standalone)

**Target:** Wi-Fi-enabled boards (ESP32, Raspberry Pi).

ZeroClaw runs **directly on the device**. The board spins up a gRPC/nanoRPC server and communicates with peripherals locally.

  Channels (WhatsApp, Telegram)
        │
        ▼
  Agent Loop (LLM calls) ──► RAG: datasheets, register maps ──► LLM context
        │
        ▼
  Code synthesis ──► Wasm / dynamic exec ──► GPIO / I2C / SPI ──► persist
        │
        ▼
  gRPC/nanoRPC server ◄──► Peripherals (GPIO, I2C, SPI, sensors, actuators)
```

**Workflow:**
1. User sends WhatsApp: *"Turn on LED on pin 13"*
2. ZeroClaw fetches board-specific docs (e.g. ESP32 GPIO mapping)
3. LLM synthesizes Rust code
4. Code runs in a sandbox (Wasm or dynamic linking)
5. GPIO is toggled; result returned to user
6. Optimized code is persisted for future "Turn on LED" requests

**All happens on-device.** No host required.

### Mode 2: Host-Mediated (Development / Debugging)

**Target:** Hardware connected via USB / J-Link / Aardvark to a host (macOS, Linux).

ZeroClaw runs on the **host** and maintains a hardware-aware link to the target. Used for development, introspection, and flashing.

```text
  ZeroClaw on Mac (host)              STM32 Nucleo-F401RE (or other MCU)
  ─────────────────────              ──────────────────────────────────
  - Channels                         - Memory map
  - LLM                              - Peripherals (GPIO, ADC, I2C)
  - Hardware probe        ◄────────► - Flash / RAM
  - Flash / debug
                       USB / J-Link / Aardvark
                       VID/PID discovery
```

**Workflow:**
1. User sends Telegram: *"What are the readable memory addresses on this USB device?"*
2. ZeroClaw identifies connected hardware (VID/PID, architecture)
3. Performs memory mapping; suggests available address spaces
4. Returns result to user

**Or:**
1. User: *"Flash this firmware to the Nucleo"*
2. ZeroClaw writes/flashes via OpenOCD or probe-rs
3. Confirms success

**Or:**
1. ZeroClaw auto-discovers: *"STM32 Nucleo on /dev/ttyACM0, ARM Cortex-M4"*
2. Suggests: *"I can read/write GPIO, ADC, flash. What would you like to do?"*

### Mode Comparison

| Aspect           | Edge-Native                    | Host-Mediated                    |
|------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| ZeroClaw runs on | Device (ESP32, RPi)           | Host (Mac, Linux)                |
| Hardware link    | Local (GPIO, I2C, SPI)        | USB, J-Link, Aardvark            |
| LLM              | On-device or cloud (Gemini)   | Host (cloud or local)            |
| Use case         | Production, standalone         | Dev, debug, introspection       |
| Channels         | WhatsApp, etc. (via WiFi)      | Telegram, CLI, etc.              |

## 3. Legacy / Simpler Modes (Pre-LLM-on-Edge)

For boards without WiFi or before full Edge-Native is ready:

### Mode A: Host + Remote Peripheral (STM32 via serial)

Host runs ZeroClaw; peripheral runs minimal firmware. Simple JSON over serial.

### Mode B: RPi as Host (Native GPIO)

ZeroClaw on Pi; GPIO via rppal or sysfs. No separate firmware.

## 4. Technical Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Language** | Pure Rust. `no_std` where applicable for embedded targets (STM32, ESP32). |
| **Communication** | Lightweight gRPC or nanoRPC stack for low-latency command processing. |
| **Dynamic execution** | Safely run LLM-generated logic on-the-fly: Wasm runtime for isolation, or dynamic linking where supported. |
| **Documentation retrieval** | RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to feed datasheet snippets, register maps, and pinouts into LLM context. |
| **Hardware discovery** | VID/PID-based identification for USB devices; architecture detection (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, etc.). |

### RAG Pipeline (Datasheet Retrieval)

- **Index:** Datasheets, reference manuals, register maps (PDF → chunks, embeddings).
- **Retrieve:** On user query ("turn on LED"), fetch relevant snippets (e.g. GPIO section for target board).
- **Inject:** Add to LLM system prompt or context.
- **Result:** LLM generates accurate, board-specific code.

### Dynamic Execution Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|------|
| **Wasm** | Sandboxed, portable, no FFI | Overhead; limited HW access from Wasm |
| **Dynamic linking** | Native speed, full HW access | Platform-specific; security concerns |
| **Interpreted DSL** | Safe, auditable | Slower; limited expressiveness |
| **Pre-compiled templates** | Fast, secure | Less flexible; requires template library |

**Recommendation:** Start with pre-compiled templates + parameterization; evolve to Wasm for user-defined logic once stable.

## 5. CLI and Config

See the [CLI reference](../reference/cli.md) for `zeroclaw hardware` / `zeroclaw peripheral` subcommands and the [Config reference](../reference/config.md) for the `[peripherals]` and `[[peripherals.boards]]` fields.

## 6. Architecture: Peripheral as Extension Point

### New Trait: `Peripheral`

```rust
/// A hardware peripheral that exposes capabilities as tools.
#[async_trait]
pub trait Peripheral: Send + Sync {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
    fn board_type(&self) -> &str;  // e.g. "nucleo-f401re", "rpi-gpio"
    async fn connect(&mut self) -> anyhow::Result<()>;
    async fn disconnect(&mut self) -> anyhow::Result<()>;
    async fn health_check(&self) -> bool;
    /// Tools this peripheral provides (gpio_read, gpio_write, sensor_read, etc.)
    fn tools(&self) -> Vec<Box<dyn Tool>>;
}
```

### Flow

1. **Startup:** ZeroClaw loads config, sees `peripherals.boards`.
2. **Connect:** For each board, create a `Peripheral` impl, call `connect()`.
3. **Tools:** Collect tools from all connected peripherals; merge with default tools.
4. **Agent loop:** Agent can call `gpio_write`, `sensor_read`, etc., these delegate to the peripheral.
5. **Shutdown:** Call `disconnect()` on each peripheral.

### Board Support

Boards are identified by USB VID/PID in the canonical registry:

{{#include ../_snippets/hardware-boards.md}}

Each connected board is driven over one of the subsystem transports:

{{#include ../_snippets/hardware-transports.md}}

The base tools every board exposes, plus the Aardvark-conditional set, are
listed in [Hardware subsystem → Runtime tools](./subsystem.md#runtime-tools).

## 7. Communication Protocols

### gRPC / nanoRPC (Edge-Native, Host-Mediated)

For low-latency, typed RPC between ZeroClaw and peripherals:

- **nanoRPC** or **tonic** (gRPC): Protobuf-defined services.
- Methods: `GpioWrite`, `GpioRead`, `I2cTransfer`, `SpiTransfer`, `MemoryRead`, `FlashWrite`, etc.
- Enables streaming, bidirectional calls, and code generation from `.proto` files.

### Serial Transport (Host-Mediated, legacy)

Simple JSON over serial for boards without gRPC support:

**Request (host → peripheral):**
```json
{"id":"1","cmd":"gpio_write","args":{"pin":13,"value":1}}
```

**Response (peripheral → host):**
```json
{"id":"1","ok":true,"result":"done"}
```

## 8. Firmware (Separate Repo or Crate)

- **zeroclaw-firmware** or **zeroclaw-peripheral**: a separate crate/workspace.
- Targets: `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` (STM32), `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` (RPi), etc.
- Uses `embassy` or Zephyr for STM32.
- Implements the protocol above.
- User flashes this to the board; ZeroClaw connects and discovers capabilities.

## 9. Capability Layers

The subsystem is built in layers; each is independently usable. Rather than
tracking phase status here (which drifts as work lands), the layers are:

- **Skeleton.** The `Peripheral` trait, config schema, and `zeroclaw peripheral`
  CLI. The `--peripheral` flag wires a board into the agent.
- **Host-mediated discovery.** `zeroclaw hardware discover` enumerates USB
  devices by VID/PID; the board registry maps them to architecture and name;
  `zeroclaw hardware introspect <path>` reports the memory map and peripheral
  list.
- **Serial / probe transport.** `SerialPeripheral` carries the JSON protocol
  over USB CDC; the `probe` feature adds probe-rs SWD for flash, memory map, and
  memory read (see the `hardware_*` tools).
- **RAG pipeline.** Datasheets are indexed and injected into LLM context on
  hardware queries.

  **Usage:** `zeroclaw config set peripherals.datasheet-dir docs/datasheets`.
  Place `.md` or `.txt` files named by board (e.g. `nucleo-f401re.md`,
  `rpi-gpio.md`). Files in `_generic/` or named `generic.md` apply to all
  boards. Chunks are retrieved by keyword match and injected into the user
  message context.

- **Edge-native (Raspberry Pi).** ZeroClaw runs on the Pi with native GPIO via
  rppal (the `peripheral-rpi` feature).
- **ESP32.** Host-mediated over the serial transport, same JSON protocol as
  STM32. ESP32 dev boards are in the registry by their CH340 USB VID/PID.

  **Usage:** Flash `firmware/esp32` to the ESP32, add `board = "esp32"`,
  `transport = "serial"`, `path = "/dev/ttyUSB0"` to config.

- **Dynamic execution.** LLM-generated logic runs through parameterized
  templates, with a sandboxed Wasm runtime as the longer-term direction for
  user-defined logic.

## 10. Security Considerations

- **Serial path:** Validate `path` is in allowlist (e.g. `/dev/ttyACM*`, `/dev/ttyUSB*`); never arbitrary paths.
- **GPIO:** Restrict which pins are exposed; avoid power/reset pins.
- **No secrets on peripheral:** Firmware should not store API keys; host handles auth.

## 11. Non-Goals (For Now)

- Running full ZeroClaw *on* bare STM32 (no WiFi, limited RAM), use Host-Mediated instead
- Real-time guarantees: peripherals are best-effort
- Arbitrary native code execution from LLM: prefer Wasm or templates

## 14. Raw Prompt Summary

> *"Boards like ESP, Raspberry Pi, or boards with WiFi can connect to an LLM (Gemini or open-source). ZeroClaw runs on the device, creates its own gRPC, spins it up, and communicates with peripherals. User asks via WhatsApp: 'move X arm' or 'turn on LED'. ZeroClaw gets accurate documentation, writes code, executes it, stores it optimally, runs it, and turns on the LED, all on the development board.*
>
> *For STM Nucleo connected via USB/J-Link/Aardvark to my Mac: ZeroClaw from my Mac accesses the hardware, installs or writes what it wants on the device, and returns the result. Example: 'Hey ZeroClaw, what are the available/readable addresses on this USB device?' It can figure out what's connected where and suggest."*
