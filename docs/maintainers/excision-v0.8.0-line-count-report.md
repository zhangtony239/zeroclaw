# v0.8.0 Branch Line-Count Report

Comparison of `integration/v0.8.0` (after the excision pass) vs `upstream/master` at `a461b016d`.

## Method

Lines counted via `/tmp/lcount.py` against:

- Rust files under `crates/`, `src/`, `tools/`, `xtask/`, `tests/`, `benches/`, `fuzz/`
- TypeScript / TSX / JS under `web/src/`
- Markdown under `docs/`

Categories:

- **logic** — production source code lines (Rust + TS) excluding the four below
- **tests** — files under `tests/` directories AND `#[cfg(test)] mod` blocks within source files
- **docstrings** — Rust `///` and `//!`, TypeScript `/** ... */`
- **comments** — Rust `//` (non-doc), TypeScript `//` and `/* ... */`
- **docs** — Markdown under `docs/`
- **blank** — whitespace-only lines (excluded from totals where noted)

Excluded: `target/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.git/`, `tmp/`, `docs/book/book/` (generated mdbook output), `web/src/lib/api-generated.ts` (generated TS bindings), `docs/book/po/` and `po-extract/` (translation artifacts).

## Totals

| category   | master    | branch    | Δ        |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| logic      | 187,521   | 193,324   | **+5,803** |
| tests      | 118,974   | 123,007   | +4,033   |
| docstrings | 14,765    | 17,100    | +2,335   |
| comments   | 7,572     | 8,894     | +1,322   |
| docs       | 11,512    | 14,131    | +2,619   |
| blank      | 42,590    | 44,138    | +1,548   |
| **TOTAL**  | **382,934** | **400,594** | **+17,660** |

## What this means

The v0.8.0 branch grows the repo by **+17,660 lines total**, of which:

| component | Δ      | share of growth |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| logic     | +5,803 | **33%**         |
| tests     | +4,033 | 23%             |
| docs      | +2,619 | 15%             |
| docstrings| +2,335 | 13%             |
| blank     | +1,548 | 9%              |
| comments  | +1,322 | 7%              |

**~67% of the growth is non-logic** (tests, documentation, comments, blank). The hypothesis that "a lot of the code bloat size is docs/comments/doc strings" is supported: actual production code accounts for one-third of the branch's expansion. The branch ships V0.8.0 schema overhaul + multi-agent runtime (#6272) + typed-family providers + peer-auth refactor, and most of the line count went into documenting and testing those changes rather than implementing them.

## Excision-pass contribution

The branch's pre-excision tip would have been roughly **+19,200 total** (extrapolating from the diff between the excision-pass commits — `200b8d6ec..6473818c2` — which net ≈ −1,540 lines). The excision pass accounts for roughly **8% of the branch's net growth being shaved off**.

By category, the excision pass:

- Deleted ~−1,500 lines of dead-on-arrival files, WIP stubs, dead provider helpers + tests, channel-WIP clusters, schema bloat (FeishuConfig fold), Claude Code residue, and dead config sections.
- Added ~+150 lines of new code: V2→V3 migration step for the FeishuConfig fold, three new migration tests, and the audit trail under `docs/maintainers/excision-v0.8.0-incidents.md`.

The deletions explain the negative deltas in `zeroclaw-providers` (−1,430), `zeroclaw-tools` (−795), and the test reductions in providers (−1,302). The +669 in `zeroclaw-macros` is non-excision V3 work (Configurable derive extensions for the schema overhaul).

## Headline

| | |
|---|---|
| Total branch growth | +17,660 |
| Production logic growth | **+5,803 (33%)** |
| Excision pass net | **−1,540** |

The branch is large because V0.8.0 is a large feature delivery, but the production-code surface grew by roughly one-third of the headline number. The remaining two-thirds is documentation, tests, docstrings, comments, and whitespace — the supporting infrastructure for the feature work, not the work itself.
