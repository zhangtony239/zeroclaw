    Examples:
      zeroclaw agent                              # interactive session
      zeroclaw agent -m "Summarize today's logs"  # single message

cli-acp-long-about =
    Start the ACP server (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio).

    Launches a JSON-RPC 2.0 server on stdin/stdout for IDE and tool integration. Supports session management and streaming agent responses as notifications.

    Methods: initialize, session/new, session/prompt, session/stop.

    Examples:
      zeroclaw acp                        # start ACP server

cli-daemon-long-about =
    Start the long-running autonomous daemon.

    Launches the full ZeroClaw runtime: gateway server, all configured channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.), heartbeat monitor, and the cron scheduler. This is the recommended way to run ZeroClaw in production or as an always-on assistant.

    Use 'zeroclaw service install' to register the daemon as an OS service (systemd/launchd) for auto-start on boot.

    Examples:
      zeroclaw daemon                   # use config defaults
      zeroclaw daemon -p 9090           # gateway on port 9090
      zeroclaw daemon --host 127.0.0.1  # localhost only

cli-cron-long-about =
    Configure and manage scheduled tasks.

    Schedule recurring, one-shot, or interval-based tasks using cron expressions, RFC 3339 timestamps, durations, or fixed intervals.

    Cron expressions use the standard 5-field format: 'min hour day month weekday'. Timezones default to UTC; override with --tz and an IANA timezone name.

    Examples:
      zeroclaw cron list
      zeroclaw cron add '0 9 * * 1-5' 'Good morning' --tz America/New_York --agent
      zeroclaw cron add '*/30 * * * *' 'Check system health' --agent
      zeroclaw cron add '*/5 * * * *' 'echo ok'
      zeroclaw cron add-at 2025-01-15T14:00:00Z 'Send reminder' --agent
      zeroclaw cron add-every 60000 'Ping heartbeat'
      zeroclaw cron once 30m 'Run backup in 30 minutes' --agent
      zeroclaw cron pause TASK_ID
      zeroclaw cron update TASK_ID --expression '0 8 * * *' --tz Europe/London

cli-channel-long-about =
    Manage communication channels.

    Add, remove, list, send, and health-check channels that connect ZeroClaw to messaging platforms. Supported channel types: telegram, discord, slack, whatsapp, matrix, imessage, email.

    Examples:
      zeroclaw channel list
      zeroclaw channel doctor
      zeroclaw channel add telegram '{ "{" }"bot_token":"...","name":"my-bot"{ "}" }'
      zeroclaw channel remove my-bot
      zeroclaw channel bind-telegram zeroclaw_user
      zeroclaw channel send 'Alert!' --channel-id telegram --recipient 123456789

cli-hardware-long-about =
    Discover and introspect USB hardware.

    Enumerate connected USB devices, identify known development boards (STM32 Nucleo, Arduino, ESP32), and retrieve chip information via probe-rs / ST-Link.

    Examples:
      zeroclaw hardware discover
      zeroclaw hardware introspect /dev/ttyACM0
      zeroclaw hardware info --chip STM32F401RETx

cli-peripheral-long-about =
    Manage hardware peripherals.

    Add, list, flash, and configure hardware boards that expose tools to the agent (GPIO, sensors, actuators). Supported boards: nucleo-f401re, rpi-gpio, esp32, arduino-uno.

    Examples:
      zeroclaw peripheral list
      zeroclaw peripheral add nucleo-f401re /dev/ttyACM0
      zeroclaw peripheral add rpi-gpio native
      zeroclaw peripheral flash --port /dev/cu.usbmodem12345
      zeroclaw peripheral flash-nucleo

cli-memory-long-about =
    Manage agent memory entries.

    List, inspect, and clear memory entries stored by the agent. Supports filtering by category and session, pagination, and batch clearing with confirmation.

    Examples:
      zeroclaw memory stats
      zeroclaw memory list
      zeroclaw memory list --category core --limit 10
      zeroclaw memory get KEY
      zeroclaw memory clear --category conversation --yes

cli-config-long-about =
    Manage ZeroClaw configuration.

    View, set, or initialize config properties by dotted path. Use 'schema' to dump the full JSON Schema for the config file.

    Properties are addressed by dotted path (e.g. channels.matrix.mention-only).
    Secret fields (API keys, tokens) automatically use masked input.
    Enum fields offer interactive selection when value is omitted.

    Examples:
      zeroclaw config list                                  # list all properties
      zeroclaw config list --secrets                        # list only secrets
      zeroclaw config list --filter channels.matrix         # filter by prefix
      zeroclaw config get channels.matrix.mention-only      # get a value
      zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.mention-only true # set a value
      zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.access-token      # secret: masked input
      zeroclaw config set channels.matrix.stream-mode       # enum: interactive select
      zeroclaw config init channels.matrix                  # init section with defaults
      zeroclaw config schema                                # print JSON Schema to stdout
      zeroclaw config schema > schema.json

    Property path tab completion is included automatically in `zeroclaw completions <shell>`.

cli-update-long-about =
    Check for and apply ZeroClaw updates.

    By default, downloads and installs the latest release with a 6-phase pipeline: preflight, download, backup, validate, swap, and smoke test. Automatic rollback on failure.

    Use --check to only check for updates without installing.
    Use --force to skip the confirmation prompt.
    Use --version to target a specific release instead of latest.

    Examples:
      zeroclaw update                      # download and install latest
      zeroclaw update --check              # check only, don't install
      zeroclaw update --force              # install without confirmation
      zeroclaw update --version 0.6.0      # install specific version

cli-self-test-long-about =
    Run diagnostic self-tests to verify the ZeroClaw installation.

    By default, runs the full test suite including network checks (gateway health, memory round-trip). Use --quick to skip network checks for faster offline validation.

    Examples:
      zeroclaw self-test             # full suite
      zeroclaw self-test --quick     # quick checks only (no network)

cli-skills-install-suggestion =
    It looks like this request needs the `{$name}` skill, but it is not installed.

    Matched capability: {$matched}
    Next: Run `{$install_command}` to install it.

cli-completions-long-about =
    Generate shell completion scripts for `zeroclaw`.

    The script is printed to stdout so it can be sourced directly:

    Examples:
      source <(zeroclaw completions bash)
      zeroclaw completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_zeroclaw
      zeroclaw completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/zeroclaw.fish

cli-desktop-long-about =
    Launch the ZeroClaw companion desktop app.

    The companion app is a lightweight menu bar / system tray application that connects to the same gateway as the CLI. It provides quick access to the dashboard, status monitoring, and device pairing.

    Use --install to download the pre-built companion app for your platform.

    Examples:
      zeroclaw desktop              # launch the companion app
      zeroclaw desktop --install    # download and install it
