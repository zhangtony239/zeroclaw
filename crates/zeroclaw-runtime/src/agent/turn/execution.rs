//! The resolved per-agent execution context the turn engine requires.
//!
//! `ToolLoop` (the engine's input) carries two kinds of state: values that are
//! stable for every turn to a given agent (the model binding, the gated tool
//! registry, the approval policy, the resolved runtime knobs) and values that
//! change every message (history, streaming sinks, steering, the ingress
//! envelope). This module groups the *stable* half into one bundle so the
//! engine accepts it as a single required input.
//!
//! Two layers:
//! - [`ResolvedModelAccess`]: the bare model binding (provider + model +
//!   temperature). Any LLM call needs it; the agent bundle composes it.
//! - [`ResolvedAgentExecution`]: the full per-agent policy: the model access
//!   plus the tool registry, approval, observability, and the resolved runtime
//!   knobs.
//!
//! G0 is a behavior-neutral regrouping: the field names mirror the engine's
//! former flat `ToolLoop` fields one-for-one, so the loop body is unchanged
//! after it destructures the bundle. Later epics move the *resolution* of these
//! fields into a single `resolve()` constructor and seal the inputs so a turn
//! cannot run with a partially- or un-resolved policy.
