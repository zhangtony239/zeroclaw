//! Non-fatal validation warnings — config that loads and validates
//! successfully (i.e. `Config::validate()` returns `Ok(())`) but will fail
//! at agent runtime because of a logical inconsistency the schema can't
//! enforce structurally.
//!
//! The CLI surfaces these via `zeroclaw_log::record!` so operators see them on
//! stderr. The gateway HTTP API surfaces them via the `warnings` field on
//! `PropResponse` / `PatchResponse` so dashboard callers see the same
//! signal — closing the parity gap that previously left a dashboard user
//! with no indication their config would fail at runtime.
//!
//! Each warning carries:
//! - a stable `code` (machine-friendly, matches across releases for a
//!   given check)
//! - a human-readable `message` (suitable for direct display to operators)
//! - the dotted property `path` the warning concerns (so the dashboard
//!   can highlight the offending field)
//!
//! Adding a new warning: append the check to `Config::collect_warnings`
//! in `schema.rs` and pick a stable `code`. `Config::validate` emits each
//! collected warning via `zeroclaw_log::record!` so logs continue to show them.
