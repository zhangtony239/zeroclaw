//! Single-use, TTL-swept registry binding a component `custom_id` to the
//! server-side intent it resolves.
//!
//! A component click echoes back only the `custom_id` we put on it — a
//! client-controlled string. So the *meaning* of a component must never be
//! trusted from the wire: the sender registers the intent here when it emits the
//! component, and the inbound dispatch `take`s it (removing it) on the click. A
//! `custom_id` that isn't in the registry — forged, replayed, or expired —
//! resolves to nothing and is refused, so a crafted id can't drive an arbitrary
//! action. This is the replay/forgery half of the component security model; the
//! per-click `interaction_gate` (fail-closed authz) is the other half.
