//! Agent evaluation harness for ZeroClaw.
//!
//! **Phase 0 — deterministic replay.** This crate runs the *real* agent loop
//! ([`zeroclaw_runtime`]) against scripted LLM responses (an [`LlmTrace`] fixture)
//! and grades the outcome against declarative [`TraceExpects`]. Because the LLM
//! responses are fixed, a replay eval is free, fast, and fully deterministic —
//! it proves the agent *machinery* (tool parsing, dispatch, multi-turn looping)
//! behaves correctly given a known model output. It does **not** measure model
//! quality; that is the live mode added in later phases.
//!
//! ## Pieces
//! - [`case`] — the [`LlmTrace`] fixture/case format and suite loading.
//! - [`replay::TraceLlmProvider`] — a [`ModelProvider`](zeroclaw_api::model_provider::ModelProvider)
//!   that replays trace steps per turn, FIFO within each turn's boundary.
//! - [`tools`] — deterministic built-in tools the replay agent can dispatch.
//! - [`observer::RecordingObserver`] — captures tool-call names/outcomes and token
//!   usage from the agent run.
//! - [`grader`] — non-panicking [`GradeResult`](grader::GradeResult) checks over a run.
//! - [`runner`] — builds an isolated agent per case, drives it, and grades it.
//! - [`report`] — pass/fail aggregation and table/JSON rendering.
