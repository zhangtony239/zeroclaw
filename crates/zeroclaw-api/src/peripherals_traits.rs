//! Peripheral trait — hardware boards (STM32, RPi GPIO) that expose tools.
//!
//! Peripherals are the agent's "arms and legs": remote devices that run minimal
//! firmware and expose capabilities (GPIO, sensors, actuators) as tools.
//! See `docs/hardware-peripherals-design.md` for the communication protocol
//! and firmware integration guide.

/// A hardware peripheral that exposes capabilities as agent tools.
///
/// Implement this trait for each supported board type (e.g., Nucleo-F401RE
/// over serial, Raspberry Pi GPIO via sysfs/gpiod). When the agent connects
/// to a peripheral, the tools returned by [`tools`](Peripheral::tools) are
/// merged into the agent's tool registry, making hardware capabilities
/// available to the LLM as callable functions.
///
/// The lifecycle follows a connect → use → disconnect pattern. Implementations
/// must be `Send + Sync` because the peripheral may be accessed from multiple
/// async tasks after connection.
