//! Unified log emission surface for the ZeroClaw workspace.
//!
//! Every crate that emits domain events (agent activity, channel I/O, cron
//! runs, tool calls, memory ops, session lifecycle, errors) goes through
//! [`record!`]. That single emission point fans out to:
//!
//! 1. A `tracing::event!` at the matching severity so `RUST_LOG`-gated
//!    terminal output and any external `tracing-subscriber` consumer see
//!    the event with structured `key=value` fields.
//! 2. The persisted JSONL log at `<workspace>/state/runtime-trace.jsonl`
//!    (when `[observability] log_persistence` is `"rolling"` or `"full"`).
//! 3. The process-wide broadcast channel so the dashboard's SSE stream
//!    sees every event live.
//!
//! Schema is an OTel/ECS hybrid with a ZeroClaw-domain `zeroclaw.*`
//! namespace for the alias-bound attribution fields. See [`event::LogEvent`].
