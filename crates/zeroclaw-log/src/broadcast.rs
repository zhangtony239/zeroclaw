//! Process-wide broadcast channel for the canonical log stream.

//! The gateway installs a [`tokio::sync::broadcast::Sender<Value>`] here at
//! startup; every event passing through [`crate::record_event`] is fanned
//! out to that channel so SSE clients (and any other in-process subscriber)
//! see the live stream.
//!
//! Lives in this crate, not in zeroclaw-runtime, so the dependency graph
//! stays clean: zeroclaw-api → zeroclaw-config → zeroclaw-log → everything
//! else.
